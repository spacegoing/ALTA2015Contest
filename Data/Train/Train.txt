2 Russia
3 has
4 stepped
5 up
6 its
7 rhetoric
8 against
9 Ukraine's
10 new
11 Western
12 leaning
13 leadership
14 as
15 tensions
16 rise
17 over
18 the
19 ousting
20 of
21 President
22 Viktor
23 Yanukovych.
24 Russian
25 PM
26 Dmitry
27 Medvedev
28 said
29 interim
30 authorities
31 in
32 Kiev
33 had
34 conducted
35 an
36 armed
37 mutiny.
38 And
39 the
40 Russian
41 foreign
42 ministry
43 said
44 dissenters
45 in
46 mainly
47 Russian
48 speaking
49 regions
50 faced
51 suppression.
52 Earlier
53 Ukraine's
54 interim
55 interior
56 minister
57 said
58 an
59 arrest
60 warrant
61 had
62 been
63 issued
64 for
65 Mr
66 Yanukovych
67 MPs
68 voted
69 to
70 remove
71 Mr
72 Yanukovych
73 on
74 Saturday.
75 His
76 where
77 abouts
78 are
79 unknown
80 but
81 he
82 was
83 reported
84 to
85 have
86 been
87 in
88 the
89 Crimean
90 peninsula
91 on
92 Sunday.
93 Russia
94 has
95 already
96 recalled
97 its
98 ambassador
99 to
100 Ukraine
101 for
102 consultation.
103 Unrest
104 in
105 Ukraine
106 began
107 in
108 November
109 when
110 Mr
111 Yanukovych
112 rejected
113 a
114 landmark
115 association
116 and
117 trade
118 deal
119 with
120 the
121 EU
122 in
123 favour
124 of
125 closer
126 ties
127 with
128 Russia,
129 Mr
130 Medvedev
131 quoted
132 by
133 Russian
134 news
135 agencies
136 suggested
137 that
138 Western
139 countries
140 that
141 accepted
142 Ukraine's
143 new
144 authorities
145 were
146 mistaken.
147 The
148 legitimacy
149 of
150 a
151 whole
152 number
153 of
154 organs
155 of
156 power
157 that
158 function
159 there
160 raises
161 great
162 doubts,
163 he
164 said.
165 Some
166 of
167 our
168 foreign
169 Western
170 partners
171 think
172 otherwise
173 This
174 is
175 some
176 kind
177 of
178 aberration
179 of
180 perception
181 when
182 people
183 call
184 legitimate
185 what
186 is
187 essentially
188 the
189 result
190 of
191 an
192 armed
193 mutiny.
194 He
195 added,
196 we
197 do
198 not
199 understand
200 what
201 is
202 going
203 on
204 there,
205 there
206 is
207 a
208 real
209 threat
210 to
211 our
212 interests
213 and
214 to
215 the
216 lives
217 of
218 our
219 citizens.
220 Ukraine's
221 foreign
222 ministry
223 quickly
224 responded
225 to
226 Mr
227 Medvedev's
228 comments
229 on
230 Russian
231 citizens
232 in
233 Ukraine
234 saying
235 his
236 concerns
237 were
238 unfounded.
239 However,
240 Russia's
241 foreign
242 ministry
243 also
244 issued
245 a
246 strongly
247 worded
248 statement,
249 saying
250 a
251 forced
252 change
253 of
254 power
255 was
256 taking
257 place
258 in
259 Ukraine
260 and
261 accused
262 interim
263 leaders
264 of
265 passing
266 new
267 laws
268 aimed
269 at
270 infringing
271 the
272 humanitarian
273 rights
274 of
275 Russians
276 and
277 other
278 ethnic
279 minorities.
280 <docid 2>
281 On
282 Monday,
283 Mr
284 Hagel
285 noted
286 the
287 US
288 military
289 had
290 come
291 under
292 pressure
293 to
294 downsize
295 after
296 two
297 costly
298 foreign
299 wars.
300 This
301 is
302 a
303 time
304 for
305 reality,
306 he
307 said.
308 This
309 is
310 a
311 budget
312 that
313 recognises
314 the
315 reality
316 of
317 the
318 magnitude
319 of
320 our
321 fiscal
322 challenges.
323 The
324 number
325 of
326 active-duty
327 US
328 Army
329 members
330 was
331 already
332 expected
333 to
334 be
335 pared
336 down
337 to
338 490,000,
339 as
340 the
341 US
342 prepares
343 to
344 end
345 its
346 combat
347 role
348 in
349 Afghanistan
350 later
351 this
352 year.
353 Mr
354 Hagel
355 added:
356 Since
357 we
358 are
359 no
360 longer
361 sizing
362 the
363 force
364 for
365 prolonged
366 stability
367 operations,
368 an
369 Army
370 of
371 this
372 size
373 is
374 larger
375 than
376 required
377 to
378 meet
379 the
380 demands
381 of
382 our
383 defence
384 strategy.
385 He
386 said
387 the
388 administration
389 would
390 also
391 recommend
392 closing
393 some
394 domestic
395 military
396 bases
397 in
398 2017,
399 though
400 such
401 proposals
402 have
403 been
404 rejected
405 by
406 Congress
407 in
408 recent
409 years.
410 The
411 Pentagon
412 chief
413 went
414 on
415 to
416 unveil
417 plans
418 for
419 changes
420 to
421 pay
422 and
423 benefits,
424 including
425 curbing
426 housing
427 allowances
428 and
429 limiting
430 pay
431 raises.
432 He
433 said
434 that
435 even
436 after
437 the
438 cuts
439 in
440 troop
441 levels
442 and
443 the
444 elimination
445 of
446 the
447 A-10
448 and
449 U-2
450 aeroplanes,
451 overall
452 military
453 spending
454 including
455 for
456 the
457 war
458 in
459 Afghanistan
460 and
461 on
462 the
463 US
464 nuclear
465 weapons
466 programme
467 will
468 remain
469 near
470 2005
471 levels.
472 That
473 level
474 is
475 scores
476 of
477 billions
478 above
479 what
480 we
481 spent
482 during
483 the
484 Cold
485 War
486 when
487 the
488 threats
489 were
490 real
491 and
492 huge,
493 he
494 told
495 the
496 BBC.
497 We're
498 making
499 all
500 the
501 wrong
502 decisions
503 in
504 terms
505 of
506 the
507 bang
508 for
509 the
510 buck
511 that
512 we're
513 getting
514 for
515 the
516 budget.
517 We
518 will
519 be
520 spending
521 multiples
522 of
523 what
524 China
525 and
526 Russia
527 spend
528 combined.
529 And
530 even
531 the
532 relative
533 modest
534 cost-cutting
535 drive
536 could
537 well
538 cause
539 ructions
540 on
541 Capitol
542 Hill,
543 which
544 is
545 gearing
546 up
547 for
548 November's
549 midterm
550 elections.
551 Reaction
552 to
553 the
554 proposal
555 was
556 swift,
557 with
558 Republican
559 members
560 warning
561 such
562 cuts
563 could
564 hurt
565 military
566 readiness.
567 This
568 is
569 not
570 the
571 time
572 for
573 us
574 to
575 begin
576 to
577 retreat,
578 and
579 certainly
580 not
581 the
582 time
583 to
584 cut
585 our
586 military,
587 Republican
588 Representative
589 Michael
590 Turner
591 told
592 Bloomberg
593 News.
594 The
595 proposed
596 Army
597 staffing
598 levels
599 would
600 be
601 the
602 lowest
603 since
604 1940,
605 when
606 the
607 US
608 employed
609 267,767
610 active-duty
611 soldiers.
612 The
613 US
614 entered
615 that
616 conflict
617 in
618 1941
619 following
620 the
621 Japanese
622 attack
623 on
624 Pearl
625 Harbor.
626 By
627 the
628 end
629 of
630 World
631 War
632 Two,
633 there
634 were
635 8.2
636 million
637 active-duty
638 US
639 Army
640 members,
641 according
642 to
643 figures
644 provided
645 on
646 Monday
647 by
648 the
649 Pentagon.
650 The
651 number
652 was
653 482,000
654 in
655 2000,
656 a
657 year
658 before
659 the
660 attacks
661 of
662 11
663 September
664 2001.
665 After
666 those
667 attacks,
668 the
669 force
670 peaked
671 at
672 566,000
673 in
674 2010.
675 <docid 3>
676 The
677 Nigerian
678 president
679 has
680 defended
681 the
682 army's
683 efforts
684 against
685 Islamist
686 militants
687 in
688 the
689 north,
690 after
691 over
692 200
693 civilians
694 died
695 in
696 attacks
697 last
698 week.
699 Addressing
700 recent
701 criticism,
702 President
703 Goodluck
704 Jonathan
705 said
706 the
707 fight
708 against
709 Boko
710 Haram
711 will
712 improve.
713 It
714 comes
715 after
716 the
717 governor
718 of
719 the
720 worst
721 affected
722 state,
723 Borno,
724 called
725 for
726 more
727 troops
728 to
729 be
730 deployed
731 to
732 the
733 area.
734 Boko
735 Haram
736 has
737 been
738 conducting
739 a
740 four-year
741 campaign
742 of
743 violence
744 to
745 push
746 for
747 Islamic
748 rule
749 in
750 northern
751 Nigeria.
752 Speaking
753 at
754 a
755 press
756 conference
757 on
758 Monday,
759 President
760 Jonathan
761 criticised
762 the
763 governor
764 of
765 Borno
766 state,
767 Kashim
768 Shettima,
769 who
770 recently
771 stated
772 that
773 the
774 Boko
775 Haram
776 militants
777 were
778 better
779 armed
780 and
781 more
782 motivated
783 than
784 the
785 Nigeria
786 military.
787 He
788 also
789 defended
790 his
791 decision
792 to
793 suspend
794 the
795 outspoken
796 central
797 bank
798 governor,
799 Lamido
800 Sanusi,
801 suggesting
802 it
803 had
804 nothing
805 to
806 do
807 with
808 the
809 governor's
810 decision
811 to
812 expose
813 corruption
814 in
815 the
816 oil
817 sector.
818 Mr
819 Jonathan
820 told
821 reporters
822 if
823 the
824 Borno
825 state
826 governor
827 felt
828 the
829 military
830 were
831 not
832 useful,
833 he
834 would
835 pull
836 them
837 out
838 of
839 the
840 state
841 for
842 a
843 month.
844 He
845 then
846 suggested
847 it
848 would
849 become
850 so
851 unsafe
852 that
853 even
854 the
855 governor
856 would
857 not
858 be
859 able
860 to
861 stay
862 there.
863 The
864 BBC's
865 Will
866 Ross
867 in
868 Lagos
869 says
870 this
871 comment
872 is
873 likely
874 to
875 anger
876 people
877 who
878 have
879 had
880 their
881 lives
882 turned
883 upside
884 down
885 by
886 the
887 violence.
888 Witnesses
889 complain
890 that
891 Boko
892 Haram
893 attacks
894 have
895 at
896 times
897 lasted
898 for
899 several
900 hours
901 without
902 any
903 response
904 from
905 the
906 armed
907 forces.
908 Governor
909 Kashim
910 Shettim
911 called
912 for
913 reinforcements
914 in
915 the
916 wake
917 of
918 a
919 five
920 hour
921 attack
922 on
923 the
924 Nigerian
925 border
926 town
927 of
928 Bama
929 last
930 week.
931 A
932 week
933 earlier,
934 106
935 people
936 were
937 killed
938 by
939 gunmen
940 in
941 a
942 raid
943 on
944 the
945 town
946 of
947 Izghe.
948 Speaking
949 to
950 the
951 BBC
952 on
953 Monday,
954 Borno
955 state
956 Senator
957 Ali
958 Ndume
959 expressed
960 outrage
961 after
962 the
963 military
964 forces
965 failed
966 to
967 prevent
968 a
969 second
970 attack
971 on
972 the
973 town.
974 Mr
975 Ndume
976 said
977 the
978 state
979 of
980 emergency
981 imposed
982 last
983 year
984 by
985 the
986 government
987 in
988 Borno,
989 Yobe
990 and
991 Adamawa
992 to
993 end
994 the
995 insurgency
996 was
997 not
998 working.
999 More
1000 than
1001 245
1002 people
1003 have
1004 been
1005 killed
1006 this
1007 year
1008 alone
1009 by
1010 suspected
1011 Islamists.
1012 On
1013 the
1014 suspension
1015 of
1016 the
1017 central
1018 bank
1019 governor,
1020 Mr
1021 Jonathan
1022 said
1023 Lamido
1024 Sanusi
1025 had
1026 to
1027 step
1028 aside
1029 to
1030 allow
1031 an
1032 investigation
1033 into
1034 financial
1035 malpractice
1036 at
1037 the
1038 central
1039 bank.
1040 But
1041 many
1042 Nigerians
1043 believe
1044 the
1045 real
1046 reason
1047 Mr
1048 Sanusi
1049 was
1050 suspended
1051 was
1052 because
1053 he
1054 had
1055 ruffled
1056 feathers
1057 by
1058 alleging
1059 that
1060 the
1061 state
1062 oil
1063 company
1064 had
1065 failed
1066 to
1067 account
1068 properly
1069 for
1070 $20bn
1071 worth
1072 of
1073 oil,
1074 says
1075 the
1076 BBC's
1077 Will
1078 Ross.
1079 The
1080 ex-
1081 bank
1082 governor
1083 was
1084 in
1085 the
1086 midst
1087 of
1088 presenting
1089 evidence
1090 to
1091 parliament,
1092 fuelling
1093 speculation
1094 that
1095 his
1096 suspension
1097 was
1098 an
1099 attempt
1100 to
1101 silence
1102 a
1103 whistleblower.

1105 Italy's
1106 newly
1107 sworn-in
1108 Prime
1109 Minister
1110 Matteo
1111 Renzi
1112 set
1113 out
1114 a
1115 bold
1116 vision
1117 of
1118 reform,
1119 hours
1120 before
1121 winning
1122 a
1123 crucial
1124 confidence
1125 vote
1126 in
1127 his
1128 new
1129 government.
1130 Mr
1131 Renzi
1132 proposed
1133 election
1134 law
1135 changes,
1136 tax
1137 cuts
1138 and
1139 investment
1140 in
1141 jobs
1142 to
1143 tackle
1144 Italy's
1145 ailing
1146 economy.
1147 The
1148 Democratic
1149 Party
1150 leader
1151 also
1152 said
1153 he
1154 wanted
1155 to
1156 abolish
1157 the
1158 upper
1159 house
1160 of
1161 parliament
1162 as
1163 a
1164 law-making
1165 body.
1166 Early
1167 on
1168 Tuesday,
1169 his
1170 broad
1171 coalition
1172 won
1173 a
1174 vote
1175 of
1176 confidence
1177 in
1178 the
1179 Senate
1180 by
1181 169
1182 votes
1183 in
1184 favour
1185 to
1186 139
1187 against.
1188 He
1189 still
1190 needs
1191 to
1192 win
1193 a
1194 second
1195 confidence
1196 vote
1197 later
1198 on
1199 Tuesday
1200 in
1201 the
1202 lower
1203 house,
1204 where
1205 his
1206 centre-left
1207 Democratic
1208 Party
1209 holds
1210 a
1211 strong
1212 majority.
1213 The
1214 Democratic
1215 Party
1216 leader,
1217 who
1218 is
1219 not
1220 an
1221 MP,
1222 acknowledged
1223 that
1224 at
1225 39,
1226 he
1227 was
1228 not
1229 even
1230 old
1231 enough
1232 to
1233 be
1234 a
1235 member
1236 of
1237 the
1238 upper
1239 house.
1240 The
1241 minimum
1242 age
1243 for
1244 a
1245 senator
1246 is
1247 40.
1248 He
1249 told
1250 senators
1251 he
1252 wanted
1253 to
1254 start
1255 reforms
1256 to
1257 the
1258 upper
1259 house
1260 as
1261 early
1262 as
1263 next
1264 month.
1265 The
1266 Senate
1267 vote,
1268 and
1269 the
1270 majority
1271 Mr
1272 Renzi
1273 managed
1274 to
1275 secure,
1276 was
1277 seen
1278 as
1279 a
1280 key
1281 test
1282 of
1283 his
1284 power
1285 to
1286 unite
1287 warring
1288 factions
1289 in
1290 Italy's
1291 parliament.
1292 However,
1293 he
1294 failed
1295 to
1296 secure
1297 a
1298 larger
1299 majority
1300 than
1301 his
1302 rival
1303 Enrico
1304 Letta
1305 whom
1306 he
1307 swept
1308 from
1309 power
1310 earlier
1311 this
1312 month.
1313 Mr
1314 Letta
1315 won
1316 173
1317 votes
1318 in
1319 the
1320 320-seat
1321 upper
1322 house
1323 as
1324 recently
1325 as
1326 December.
1327 The
1328 16-strong
1329 government,
1330 in
1331 which
1332 half
1333 the
1334 ministers
1335 are
1336 women,
1337 has
1338 an
1339 average
1340 age
1341 of
1342 under
1343 48,
1344 the
1345 youngest
1346 in
1347 modern
1348 Italian
1349 history.
1350 Mr
1351 Renzi,
1352 who
1353 is
1354 also
1355 mayor
1356 of
1357 Florence,
1358 told
1359 the
1360 Senate
1361 on
1362 Monday
1363 that
1364 Italy,
1365 the
1366 third
1367 biggest
1368 economy
1369 in
1370 the
1371 eurozone,
1372 had
1373 to
1374 get
1375 serious
1376 about
1377 tackling
1378 its
1379 public
1380 finances.
1381 It
1382 was
1383 not
1384 because
1385 of
1386 pressure
1387 from
1388 German
1389 Chancellor
1390 Angela
1391 Merkel
1392 or
1393 the
1394 head
1395 of
1396 the
1397 European
1398 Central
1399 Bank,
1400 he
1401 said,
1402 but
1403 because
1404 we
1405 have
1406 to
1407 do
1408 it
1409 out
1410 of
1411 respect
1412 for
1413 our
1414 children.

1420 owner
1421 of
1422 China's
1423 largest
1424 Twitter-like
1425 site
1426 Weibo,
1427 surged
1428 in
1429 the
1430 fourth
1431 quarter,
1432 boosted
1433 by
1434 a
1435 jump
1436 in
1437 advertising
1438 revenue.
1439 It
1440 reported
1441 a
1442 net
1443 profit
1444 of
1445 $44.5m
1446 (£26.7m)
1447 in
1448 the
1449 October
1450 to
1451 December
1452 period,
1453 up
1454 from
1455 $2.4m
1456 a
1457 year
1458 ago.
1459 The
1460 numbers
1461 come
1462 amid
1463 reports
1464 that
1465 Sina
1466 is
1467 planning
1468 to
1469 list
1470 Weibo
1471 in
1472 the
1473 US
1474 and
1475 that
1476 it
1477 plans
1478 to
1479 raise
1480 nearly
1481 $500m
1482 by
1483 selling
1484 Weibo
1485 shares.
1486 Weibo
1487 claims
1488 that
1489 it
1490 has
1491 over
1492 500
1493 million
1494 registered
1495 users.
1496 China
1497 is
1498 the
1499 world's
1500 biggest
1501 internet
1502 market
1503 and
1504 social
1505 networking
1506 sites
1507 have
1508 become
1509 increasingly
1510 popular
1511 with
1512 users.
1513 As
1514 a
1515 result,
1516 many
1517 firms
1518 have
1519 turned
1520 to
1521 the
1522 medium
1523 to
1524 advertise
1525 their
1526 products
1527 and
1528 services
1529 in
1530 an
1531 attempt
1532 to
1533 attract
1534 new
1535 customers,
1536 helping
1537 boost
1538 growth
1539 of
1540 companies
1541 such
1542 as
1543 Sina.
1544 According
1545 to
1546 the
1547 firm's
1548 latest
1549 numbers,
1550 advertising
1551 revenues
1552 at
1553 Weibo
1554 rose
1555 to
1556 $56m
1557 during
1558 the
1559 fourth
1560 quarter
1561 -
1562 a
1563 163%
1564 jump
1565 from
1566 a
1567 year
1568 earlier.
1569 The
1570 strong
1571 performance
1572 of
1573 Weibo's
1574 advertising
1575 and
1576 value-added
1577 services
1578 in
1579 the
1580 fourth
1581 quarter
1582 allowed
1583 us
1584 to
1585 end
1586 2013
1587 with
1588 strong
1589 top
1590 line
1591 and
1592 bottom
1593 line
1594 growth,
1595 said
1596 Charles
1597 Chao,
1598 chief
1599 executive
1600 of
1601 Sina.
1602 However,
1603 a
1604 report
1605 published
1606 last
1607 month
1608 indicated
1609 that
1610 the
1611 number
1612 of
1613 Weibo
1614 users
1615 declined
1616 steeply
1617 in
1618 2013.
1619 The
1620 China
1621 Internet
1622 Network
1623 Information
1624 Center
1625 said
1626 in
1627 its
1628 annual
1629 report
1630 that
1631 almost
1632 28
1633 million
1634 people
1635 abandoned
1636 Weibo
1637 last
1638 year.
1639 The
1640 fall
1641 marked
1642 the
1643 site's
1644 first
1645 drop
1646 in
1647 usage
1648 amid
1649 a
1650 government
1651 crackdown
1652 on
1653 so-called
1654 rumour
1655 mongers
1656 online.
1657 Weibo's
1658 surge
1659 in
1660 popularity
1661 gave
1662 users
1663 new
1664 opportunities
1665 for
1666 self-expression,
1667 but
1668 it
1669 also
1670 attracted
1671 the
1672 attention
1673 of
1674 authorities
1675 who
1676 moved
1677 swiftly
1678 to
1679 silence
1680 voices
1681 online.
1682 A
1683 law
1684 was
1685 introduced
1686 to
1687 allow
1688 the
1689 Chinese
1690 government
1691 to
1692 jail
1693 microbloggers
1694 and
1695 dozens
1696 more
1697 were
1698 arrested.
1699 Web
1700 users
1701 are
1702 believed
1703 to
1704 have
1705 migrated
1706 to
1707 mobile
1708 messaging
1709 platforms.
1710 Mr
1711 Chao
1712 of
1713 Sina
1714 said
1715 the
1716 firm
1717 "will
1718 continue
1719 to
1720 focus
1721 on
1722 growing

1734 Roy
1735 Hodgson
1736 has
1737 signed
1738 up
1739 cycling
1740 chief
1741 Sir
1742 Dave
1743 Brailsford
1744 to
1745 boost
1746 England's
1747 World
1748 Cup
1749 preparations
1750 and
1751 may
1752 bring
1753 a
1754 psychologist
1755 in
1756 to
1757 help
1758 with
1759 penalties.
1760 Brailsford
1761 has
1762 masterminded
1763 the
1764 success
1765 in
1766 British
1767 cycling
1768 and
1769 England
1770 manager
1771 Hodgson
1772 has
1773 invited
1774 him
1775 to
1776 speak
1777 to
1778 the
1779 squad
1780 before
1781 their
1782 friendly
1783 with
1784 Peru.
1785 Hogdson
1786 says
1787 he
1788 will
1789 also
1790 consider
1791 a
1792 psychologist
1793 to
1794 work
1795 on
1796 spot-kicks.
1797 We
1798 have
1799 some
1800 confident
1801 penalty-takers,
1802 but
1803 others
1804 less
1805 confident
1806 and
1807 it's
1808 how
1809 we
1810 get
1811 to
1812 them,
1813 he
1814 told
1815 Sky
1816 Sports.
1817 England's
1818 penalty-shootout
1819 exit
1820 against
1821 Italy
1822 at
1823 the
1824 2012
1825 European
1826 Championships
1827 in
1828 Hodgson's
1829 first
1830 tournament
1831 in
1832 charge
1833 of
1834 the
1835 Three
1836 Lions
1837 was
1838 their
1839 sixth
1840 in
1841 seven
1842 attempts
1843 in
1844 major
1845 tournaments.
1846 Hodgson
1847 believes
1848 bringing
1849 in
1850 a
1851 professional
1852 sports
1853 psychologist
1854 to
1855 work
1856 on
1857 penalty
1858 kicks
1859 in
1860 training
1861 before
1862 the
1863 tournament
1864 may
1865 could
1866 leave
1867 his
1868 players
1869 better
1870 equipped
1871 to
1872 handle
1873 the
1874 pressure
1875 of
1876 a
1877 shootout.
1878 We
1879 need
1880 to
1881 know
1882 that
1883 when
1884 they
1885 go
1886 up
1887 they
1888 are
1889 as
1890 well
1891 prepared
1892 as
1893 they
1894 can
1895 be,
1896 Hodgson
1897 said.
1898 We
1899 are
1900 considering
1901 the
1902 possibility
1903 of
1904 inviting
1905 someone
1906 with
1907 us
1908 but
1909 it
1910 would
1911 have
1912 to
1913 be
1914 someone
1915 accepted
1916 by
1917 the
1918 group.
1919 It
1920 will
1921 be
1922 about
1923 their
1924 character,
1925 their
1926 confidence
1927 and
1928 their
1929 ability
1930 to
1931 block
1932 out
1933 the
1934 next
1935 morning's
1936 headlines.
1937 If
1938 a
1939 psychologist
1940 can
1941 find
1942 a
1943 way
1944 to
1945 block
1946 that
1947 out
1948 then
1949 we'd
1950 be
1951 very,
1952 very
1953 happy.
1954 Brailsford
1955 has
1956 agreed
1957 to
1958 meet
1959 England's
1960 players
1961 before
1962 they
1963 fly
1964 out
1965 to
1966 their
1967 pre-
1968 tournament
1969 base
1970 in
1971 Miami.
1972 He
1973 was
1974 knighted
1975 last
1976 year
1977 in
1978 recognition
1979 of

2118 German
2119 touring
2120 car
2121 driver
2122 sees
2123 the
2124 chance
2125 to
2126 drive
2127 on
2128 an
2129 actual
2130 grand
2131 prix
2132 weekend
2133 as
2134 a
2135 natural
2136 progression.
2137 Each
2138 step
2139 of
2140 the
2141 way,
2142 I
2143 proved
2144 myself,
2145 did
2146 a
2147 good
2148 job,
2149 gave
2150 the
2151 team
2152 what
2153 they
2154 needed
2155 in
2156 terms
2157 of
2158 feedback
2159 and
2160 that
2161 then
2162 led
2163 to
2164 more
2165 opportunity
2166 within
2167 the
2168 team,
2169 she
2170 said.
2171 Wolff
2172 is
2173 attempting
2174 to
2175 make
2176 a
2177 breakthrough
2178 in
2179 what
2180 is
2181 a
2182 male-dominated
2183 sport.
2184 Italian
2185 Giovanna
2186 Amati
2187 was
2188 the
2189 last
2190 woman
2191 to
2192 enter
2193 the
2194 world
2195 championships,
2196 though
2197 she
2198 failed
2199 to
2200 qualify
2201 for
2202 three
2203 races
2204 with
2205 Brabham
2206 in
2207 1992
2208 and
2209 was
2210 subsequently
2211 dropped.
2212 The
2213 last
2214 woman
2215 to
2216 race
2217 in
2218 an
2219 F1
2220 car
2221 was
2222 Italian
2223 Lella
2224 Lombardi
2225 in
2226 1976.
2227 But
2228 Wolff
2229 is
2230 not
2231 alone.
2232 Swiss
2233 driver
2234 Simona
2235 De
2236 Silvestro,
2237 25,
2238 joined
2239 Sauber
2240 in
2241 February
2242 with
2243 the
2244 aim
2245 of
2246 racing
2247 in
2248 2015.
2249 Wolff
2250 feels
2251 her
2252 performance
2253 at
2254 Silverstone
2255 last
2256 summer
2257 changed
2258 attitudes
2259 towards
2260 her
2261 within
2262 F1.
2263 Yes,
2264 massively,
2265 she
2266 said.
2267 There
2268 was
2269 definitely
2270 a
2271 stereotype
2272 of
2273 blonde
2274 girl
2275 walking
2276 around
2277 the
2278 paddock
2279 dreaming
2280 of
2281 being
2282 a
2283 Formula
2284 1
2285 driver
2286 and
2287 there
2288 were
2289 a
2290 lot
2291 of
2292 people
2293 in
2294 the
2295 paddock
2296 who
2297 thought
2298 it
2299 was
2300 just
2301 a
2302 marketing
2303 ploy
2304 from
2305 Williams.
2306 <docid 8>
2307 Kent
2308 have
2309 signed
2310 Australian
2311 fast
2312 bowler
2313 Doug
2314 Bollinger
2315 as
2316 their
2317 overseas
2318 player
2319 for
2320 the
2321 2014
2322 campaign.
2323 The
2324 32-year-old
2325 has
2326 taken
2327 50
2328 wickets
2329 at
2330 an
2331 average
2332 of
2333 25.92
2334 in
2335 12
2336 Test
2337 appearances
2338 and
2339 has
2340 played
2341 in
2342 39
2343 one-day
2344 internationals
2345 and
2346 two
2347 T20Is.
2348 Bollinger,
2349 a
2350 left-am
2351 seamer,
2352 last
2353 made
2354 a
2355 Test
2356 appearance
2357 in
2358 December
2359 2010,
2360 in
2361 a
2362 defeat
2363 by
2364 England
2365 in
2366 Adelaide.
2367 He
2368 has
2369 taken
2370 21
2371 wickets
2372 an
2373 an
2374 average
2375 of
2376 26.80
2377 for
2378 New
2379 South
2380 Wales
2381 in
2382 this
2383 season's
2384 Sheffield
2385 Shield
2386 competition.
2387 Bollinger
2388 had
2389 a
2390 spell
2391 in
2392 English
2393 domestic
2394 cricket
2395 with
2396 Worcestershire
2397 in
2398 2007,
2399 when
2400 his
2401 16
2402 Championship
2403 wickets
2404 came
2405 at
2406 an
2407 average
2408 of
2409 44.56.
2410 I
2411 am
2412 very
2413 excited
2414 about
2415 the
2416 opportunity
2417 to
2418 play
2419 with
2420 Kent,
2421 Bollinger
2422 said.
2423 I
2424 feel
2425 I
2426 am
2427 bowling
2428 as
2429 well
2430 as
2431 I
2432 ever
2433 have,
2434 and
2435 look
2436 forward
2437 to
2438 being
2439 able
2440 to
2441 contribute
2442 both
2443 on
2444 and
2445 off
2446 the
2447 field.
2448 I
2449 have
2450 had
2451 quite
2452 a
2453 few
2454 chats
2455 with
2456 Jimmy
2457 Adams
2458 and
2459 can't
2460 wait
2461 to
2462 get
2463 over
2464 there
2465 and
2466 rip
2467 in.
2468 Adams
2469 described
2470 Bollinger
2471 as
2472 an
2473 extremely
2474 talented
2475 player.
2476 He
2477 said:
2478 Doug
2479 is
2480 bringing
2481 a
2482 wealth
2483 of
2484 experience,
2485 having
2486 performed
2487 successfully
2488 at
2489 all
2490 levels
2491 and
2492 across
2493 all
2494 formats.
2495 We
2496 are
2497 confident
2498 he
2499 will
2500 make
2501 a
2502 positive
2503 contribution
2504 to
2505 Kent
2506 in
2507 the
2508 season
2509 ahead.
2510 Northants
2511 were
2512 unable
2513 to
2514 re-sign
2515 another
2516 Australian
2517 seamer,
2518 Trent
2519 Copeland,
2520 for
2521 this
2522 season
2523 because
2524 he
2525 did
2526 not
2527 meet
2528 visa
2529 criteria,
2530 having
2531 not
2532 played
2533 a
2534 Test
2535 match
2536 in
2537 the
2538 last
2539 two
2540 years.
2541 Bollinger's
2542 last
2543 Test
2544 appearance
2545 was
2546 against
2547 England
2548 at
2549 Adelaide
2550 in
2551 December
2552 2010,
2553 but
2554 he
2555 is
2556 eligible
2557 for
2558 a
2559 playing
2560 visa
2561 on
2562 the
2563 basis
2564 that
2565 he
2566 has
2567 played
2568 five
2569 Tests
2570 within
2571 the
2572 last
2573 five
2574 years.

2576 Flanker
2577 Peter
2578 O'Mahony
2579 is
2580 Ireland's
2581 only
2582 serious
2583 injury
2584 concern
2585 for
2586 their
2587 next
2588 Six
2589 Nations
2590 game
2591 against
2592 Italy.
2593 The
2594 Munster
2595 captain
2596 went
2597 off
2598 midway
2599 through
2600 the
2601 second
2602 half
2603 of
2604 Saturday's
2605 13-10
2606 defeat
2607 by
2608 England
2609 at
2610 Twickenham
2611 with
2612 a
2613 hamstring
2614 strain.
2615 Mahony's
2616 injury
2617 will
2618 continue
2619 to
2620 be
2621 assessed
2622 by
2623 Ireland's
2624 medical
2625 staff.
2626 Brian
2627 O'Driscoll
2628 suffered
2629 some
2630 cramping
2631 towards
2632 the
2633 end
2634 of
2635 the
2636 match
2637 and
2638 his
2639 fitness
2640 will
2641 be
2642 monitored
2643 but
2644 he
2645 should
2646 be
2647 fit
2648 to
2649 face
2650 the
2651 Italians.
2652 Both
2653 players
2654 should
2655 benefit
2656 from
2657 the
2658 fact
2659 that
2660 Ireland
2661 have
2662 a
2663 two-week
2664 break
2665 before
2666 their
2667 next
2668 fixture.
2669 Ireland
2670 head
2671 coach
2672 Joe
2673 Schmidt
2674 paid
2675 tribute
2676 to
2677 O'Mahony
2678 for
2679 being
2680 pretty
2681 generous
2682 with
2683 his
2684 body
2685 in
2686 the
2687 wake
2688 of
2689 Saturday's
2690 defeat.
2691 The
2692 former
2693 Leinster
2694 coach
2695 will
2696 want
2697 the
2698 abrasive
2699 operator
2700 fit
2701 for
2702 Ireland's
2703 Six
2704 Nations
2705 run-in,
2706 especially
2707 with
2708 the
2709 title
2710 still
2711 on
2712 the
2713 line.
2714 There
2715 are
2716 only
2717 so
2718 many
2719 seconds
2720 you
2721 can
2722 stay
2723 on
2724 the
2725 ball
2726 and
2727 be
2728 hammered
2729 away
2730 at
2731 without
2732 it
2733 taking
2734 its
2735 toll,
2736 and
2737 I
2738 thought
2739 he
2740 held
2741 on
2742 for
2743 two
2744 or
2745 three
2746 seconds
2747 at
2748 a
2749 time,
2750 said
2751 Schmidt
2752 of
2753 O'Mahony's
2754 bravery
2755 at
2756 the
2757 breakdown.
2758 Ireland's
2759 loss
2760 to
2761 England
2762 means
2763 no
2764 team
2765 can
2766 claim
2767 a
2768 Grand
2769 Slam
2770 this
2771 season,
2772 but
2773 Schmidt's
2774 side
2775 can
2776 still
2777 steal
2778 the
2779 title.
2780 England,
2781 Wales
2782 and
2783 France
2784 could
2785 all
2786 yet
2787 grab
2788 championship
2789 glory,
2790 though,
2791 leaving
2792 Schmidt
2793 circumspect
2794 about
2795 Ireland's
2796 silverware
2797 chances.
2798 After
2799 victories
2800 over
2801 Scotland
2802 and
2803 Wales,
2804 Schmidt
2805 said
2806 the
2807 England
2808 defeat
2809 means
2810 Ireland
2811 can
2812 ill
2813 afford
2814 to
2815 look
2816 any
2817 further
2818 than
2819 facing
2820 the
2821 Italians.
2822 The
2823 title
2824 might
2825 become
2826 a
2827 carrot
2828 if
2829 we
2830 can
2831 take
2832 care
2833 of
2834 Italy,
2835 said
2836 Schmidt.
2837 We
2838 have
2839 to
2840 try
2841 to
2842 build
2843 piece
2844 by
2845 piece,
2846 especially
2847 when
2848 you
2849 trip
2850 up.
2851 We'd
2852 taken
2853 two
2854 good
2855 steps,
2856 but
2857 to
2858 trip
2859 up
2860 on
2861 this
2862 one,
2863 we
2864 don't
2865 want
2866 to
2867 then
2868 try
2869 to
2870 take
2871 a
2872 giant
2873 leap,
2874 because
2875 you're
2876 not
2877 in
2878 as
2879 strong
2880 a
2881 position.
2882 You
2883 just
2884 want
2885 to
2886 make
2887 sure
2888 the
2889 next
2890 step
2891 is
2892 firmly
2893 planted,
2894 secure,
2895 and
2896 we'll
2897 work
2898 towards
2899 that
2900 over
2901 the
2902 next
2903 two
2904 weeks.
2905 Schmidt's

2908 Italy

2910 Dublin
2911 on
2912 Saturday
2913 8
2914 March

2916 their

2920 against
2921 France
2922 in
2923 Paris
2924 on

2926 March.
2927 The
2928 Ireland
2929 squad

2931 assemble
2932 on
2933 Wednesday
2934 for

2942 Venus
2943 Williams
2944 beat
2945 Alize
2946 Cornet
2947 in
2948 straight
2949 sets
2950 to
2951 win
2952 the
2953 Dubai
2954 Championships
2955 title
2956 for
2957 a
2958 third
2959 time.
2960 The
2961 33-year-old
2962 American,
2963 now
2964 down
2965 at
2966 44
2967 in
2968 the
2969 world
2970 rankings,
2971 gained
2972 revenge
2973 for
2974 her
2975 sister
2976 and
2977 world
2978 number
2979 one
2980 Serena,
2981 who
2982 suffered
2983 a
2984 semi-final
2985 defeat
2986 by
2987 the
2988 Frenchwoman
2989 on
2990 Friday.
2991 Venus
2992 used
2993 all
2994 of
2995 her
2996 experience
2997 to
2998 record
2999 a
3000 6-3
3001 6-0
3002 victory
3003 against
3004 the
3005 world
3006 number
3007 26
3008 in
3009 Saturday's
3010 final.
3011 This
3012 was
3013 her
3014 first
3015 WTA
3016 Tour
3017 title
3018 since
3019 she
3020 won
3021 in
3022 Luxembourg 
3023 in
3024 October
3025 2012.
3026 Dubai
3027 is
3028 a
3029 happy
3030 hunting
3031 ground
3032 for
3033 the
3034 seven-times
3035 Grand
3036 Slam
3037 champion.
3038 This
3039 win
3040 follows
3041 those
3042 in
3043 2009
3044 and
3045 2010.
3046 It's
3047 great
3048 to
3049 be
3050 back,
3051 said
3052 Williams.
3053 I
3054 was
3055 expecting
3056 to
3057 be
3058 playing
3059 Serena,
3060 but
3061 Alize
3062 played
3063 an
3064 amazing
3065 game
3066 in
3067 the
3068 semis,
3069 so
3070 congratulations
3071 on
3072 that.
3073 Referring
3074 to
3075 the
3076 immune
3077 deficiency
3078 which
3079 has
3080 threatened
3081 her
3082 career
3083 in
3084 recent
3085 years,
3086 she
3087 added:
3088 I
3089 have
3090 continued
3091 being
3092 able
3093 to
3094 practise,
3095 and
3096 I
3097 have
3098 been
3099 getting
3100 healthier.
3101 It
3102 hasn't
3103 been
3104 easy.
3105 I
3106 have
3107 to
3108 thank
3109 the
3110 tournament
3111 for
3112 a
3113 wild
3114 card,
3115 and
3116 my
3117 family
3118 and
3119 Serena
3120 for
3121 encouraging
3122 me.
3123 They
3124 all
3125 kept
3126 me
3127 up
3128 when
3129 I
3130 was
3131 down.
3132 Cornet's
3133 impressive
3134 victory
3135 over
3136 Serena
3137 in
3138 the
3139 last
3140 four
3141 means
3142 the
3143 Williams
3144 sisters
3145 have
3146 still
3147 not
3148 met
3149 in
3150 a
3151 final
3152 since
3153 2009.
3154 Venus
3155 was
3156 not
3157 in
3158 a
3159 mood
3160 to
3161 join
3162 her
3163 sister
3164 in
3165 defeat,
3166 however,
3167 and
3168 beat
3169 the
3170 24-year-old
3171 Frenchwoman
3172 in
3173 a
3174 match
3175 lasting
3176 91
3177 minutes.
3178 Key
3179 to
3180 the
3181 victory
3182 -
3183 her
3184 45th
3185 on
3186 the
3187 WTA
3188 Tour
3189 -
3190 was
3191 the
3192 fact
3193 she
3194 converted
3195 five
3196 of
3197 eight
3198 break
3199 points
3200 against
3201 the
3202 Cornet
3203 serve,
3204 while
3205 her
3206 French
3207 opponent
3208 only
3209 took
3210 advantage
3211 of
3212 one
3213 out
3214 of
3215 six
3216 such
3217 opportunities
3218 to
3219 come
3220 her
3221 way.
3222 Cornet,
3223 hugging
3224 the
3225 baseline
3226 just
3227 as
3228 she
3229 did
3230 against
3231 Serena,
3232 claimed
3233 the
3234 first
3235 break
3236 of
3237 the
3238 match,
3239 however,
3240 to
3241 go
3242 2-1
3243 up.
3244 But
3245 Williams
3246 responded
3247 with
3248 a
3249 brutal
3250 barrage
3251 of
3252 ground-strokes
3253 for
3254 a
3255 double
3256 break
3257 and
3258 a
3259 5-2
3260 lead.
3261 She
3262 served
3263 out
3264 for
3265 the
3266 first
3267 set
3268 and
3269 picked
3270 up
3271 another
3272 double
3273 break
3274 at
3275 the
3276 start
3277 of
3278 the
3279 second
3280 before
3281 sealing
3282 victory
3283 when
3284 Cornet
3285 lofted
3286 a
3287 forehand
3288 long.
3289 Cornet
3290 said:
3291 6-3
3292 6-0
3293 is
3294 a
3295 bit
3296 tough
3297 in
3298 an
3299 hour
3300 and
3301 30
3302 minutes,
3303 so
3304 I
3305 guess
3306 there
3307 was
3308 a
3309 battle
3310 on
3311 the
3312 court,
3313 but
3314 she
3315 was
3316 just
3317 better
3318 than
3319 me
3320 that's
3321 it,
3322 really
3323 there's
3324 nothing
3325 else
3326 to
3327 say.
3328 Venus
3329 played
3330 well
3331 the
3332 whole
3333 week
3334 and
3335 deserves
3336 this
3337 title.
3338 <docid 11>
3339 Lemmy
3340 Caution
3341 checks
3342 in.
3343 He
3344 immediately
3345 boots
3346 up
3347 his
3348 computer
3349 and
3350 hooks
3351 into
3352 the
3353 net.
3354 Routing
3355 through
3356 several
3357 nodes,
3358 he
3359 finds
3360 that
3361 a
3362 message
3363 is
3364 waiting,
3365 has
3366 been
3367 waiting
3368 for
3369 quite
3370 a
3371 while.
3372 One
3373 starless
3374 August
3375 night
3376 much
3377 like
3378 tonight,
3379 Lemmy
3380 stumbled
3381 out
3382 of
3383 the
3384 Burg
3385 Frieden
3386 in
3387 PrinzLauerBurg,
3388 then
3389 still
3390 E
3391 Berlin.
3392 Drunk,
3393 unable
3394 to
3395 move
3396 his
3397 tongue,
3398 desperately
3399 lonely,
3400 he
3401 fell
3402 into
3403 the
3404 rainy
3405 gutter.
3406 When
3407 he
3408 woke,
3409 a
3410 piece
3411 of
3412 paper
3413 was
3414 twisted
3415 in
3416 his
3417 mouth.
3418 Dried
3419 out,
3420 he
3421 read.
3422 People
3423 ask,
3424 what
3425 is
3426 the
3427 nature
3428 of
3429 the
3430 revolution
3431 that
3432 we
3433 talk
3434 about.
3435 Who
3436 will
3437 it
3438 be
3439 made
3440 by,
3441 and
3442 for,
3443 and
3444 what
3445 are
3446 its
3447 goals
3448 and
3449 strategy?
3450 We
3451 are
3452 within
3453 the
3454 heartland
3455 of
3456 a
3457 world-wide
3458 monster,
3459 a
3460 country
3461 so
3462 rich
3463 from
3464 its
3465 world-wide
3466 plunder
3467 that
3468 even
3469 the
3470 crumbs
3471 holed
3472 out
3473 to
3474 the
3475 enslaved
3476 masses
3477 within
3478 its
3479 borders
3480 provide
3481 for
3482 material
3483 existence
3484 very
3485 much
3486 above
3487 the
3488 conditions
3489 of
3490 the
3491 masses
3492 of
3493 people
3494 of
3495 the
3496 world.
3497 All
3498 of
3499 the
3500 United
3501 Airlines
3502 Astrojets,
3503 all
3504 of
3505 the
3506 Holiday
3507 Inns,
3508 all
3509 of
3510 Hertz's
3511 automobiles,
3512 your
3513 television
3514 set,
3515 car
3516 and
3517 wardrobe
3518 already
3519 belong
3520 to
3521 a
3522 large
3523 degree
3524 to
3525 the
3526 people
3527 of
3528 the
3529 rest
3530 of
3531 the
3532 world.
3533 He's
3534 been
3535 committed
3536 ever
3537 since,
3538 a
3539 clandestine
3540 freedom
3541 fighter,
3542 autonomous,
3543 placing
3544 his
3545 devices
3546 alone
3547 or
3548 with
3549 a
3550 few
3551 other
3552 cadres,
3553 exchanging
3554 plans
3555 and
3556 ideological
3557 instruction
3558 only
3559 through
3560 safe
3561 message
3562 drops.
3563 During
3564 Vietnam,
3565 it
3566 was
3567 easier,
3568 as
3569 the
3570 Vietnamese
3571 were
3572 very
3573 astute
3574 in
3575 their
3576 description
3577 of
3578 their
3579 People's
3580 War
3581 and
3582 the
3583 centrality
3584 of
3585 the
3586 anti-colonial
3587 struggle
3588 against
3589 US
3590 imperialism.
3591 At
3592 first
3593 he
3594 exchanged
3595 tangible
3596 letters,
3597 paper
3598 signs
3599 of
3600 struggle.
3601 These
3602 new
3603 electronic
3604 messages
3605 are
3606 harder
3607 to
3608 actualize
3609 in
3610 practice,
3611 and
3612 the
3613 post-socialist
3614 world
3615 of
3616 global
3617 empire
3618 far
3619 harder
3620 to
3621 conceptualize
3622 in
3623 terms
3624 of
3625 improvement
3626 and
3627 barbarism.
3628 A
3629 while
3630 ago,
3631 this:
3632 The
3633 deaths
3634 of
3635 three
3636 friends
3637 ended
3638 our
3639 military
3640 conception
3641 of
3642 what
3643 we
3644 are
3645 doing.
3646 It
3647 took
3648 us
3649 weeks
3650 of
3651 careful
3652 talking
3653 to
3654 rediscover
3655 our
3656 roots,
3657 to
3658 remember
3659 that
3660 we
3661 had
3662 been
3663 turned
3664 on
3665 to
3666 the
3667 possibilities
3668 of
3669 revolution
3670 by
3671 denying
3672 the
3673 schools,
3674 the
3675 jobs
3676 the
3677 death
3678 relationships
3679 we
3680 were
3681 educated
3682 for.
3683 We
3684 went
3685 back
3686 to
3687 how
3688 we
3689 had
3690 begun
3691 living
3692 with
3693 groups
3694 of
3695 friends
3696 and
3697 fount
3698 that
3699 this
3700 revolution
3701 could
3702 leave
3703 intact
3704 the
3705 enslavement
3706 of
3707 women
3708 if
3709 women
3710 did
3711 not
3712 fight
3713 to
3714 end
3715 and
3716 change
3717 it,
3718 together.
3719 And
3720 marijuana
3721 and
3722 LSD
3723 and
3724 little
3725 money
3726 and
3727 awakening
3728 to
3729 the
3730 black
3731 revolution,
3732 the
3733 people
3734 of
3735 the
3736 world.
3737 But
3738 tonight,
3739 for
3740 the
3741 first
3742 time
3743 in
3744 way
3745 too
3746 long,
3747 Lemmy
3748 is
3749 to
3750 meet
3751 his
3752 closest
3753 comrade.
3754 Oedipa
3755 Maas
3756 is
3757 the
3758 slinky
3759 trans
3760 revolutionary
3761 who
3762 first
3763 turned
3764 on
3765 Tania
3766 Hearst,
3767 later
3768 turning
3769 on
3770 to
3771 more
3772 productive
3773 anti-globalization
3774 struggles.
3775 Lemmy
3776 and
3777 Oedipa
3778 have
3779 not
3780 seen
3781 each
3782 other
3783 since
3784 Seattle.
3785 As
3786 he
3787 sets
3788 out
3789 the
3790 ling
3791 and
3792 the
3793 dildos,
3794 he
3795 sings,
3796 the
3797 Prince
3798 of
3799 Stories
3800 would
3801 walk
3802 right
3803 by
3804 me.
3805 <docid 12>
3806 The
3807 family
3808 of
3809 Dashwood
3810 had
3811 long
3812 been
3813 settled
3814 in
3815 Sussex.
3816 Their
3817 estate
3818 was
3819 large,
3820 and
3821 their
3822 residence
3823 was
3824 at
3825 Norland
3826 Park,
3827 in
3828 the
3829 centre
3830 of
3831 their
3832 property,
3833 where,
3834 for
3835 many
3836 generations,
3837 they
3838 had
3839 lived
3840 in
3841 so
3842 respectable
3843 a
3844 manner
3845 as
3846 to
3847 engage
3848 the
3849 general
3850 good
3851 opinion
3852 of
3853 their
3854 surrounding
3855 acquaintance.
3856 The
3857 late
3858 owner
3859 of
3860 this
3861 estate
3862 was
3863 a
3864 single
3865 man,
3866 who
3867 lived
3868 to
3869 a
3870 very
3871 advanced
3872 age,
3873 and
3874 who
3875 for
3876 many
3877 years
3878 of
3879 his
3880 life,
3881 had
3882 a
3883 constant
3884 companion
3885 and
3886 housekeeper
3887 in
3888 his
3889 sister.
3890 But
3891 her
3892 death,
3893 which
3894 happened
3895 ten
3896 years
3897 before
3898 his
3899 own,
3900 produced
3901 a
3902 great
3903 alteration
3904 in
3905 his
3906 home;
3907 for
3908 to
3909 supply
3910 her
3911 loss,
3912 he
3913 invited
3914 and
3915 received
3916 into
3917 his
3918 house
3919 the
3920 family
3921 of
3922 his
3923 nephew
3924 Mr.
3925 Henry
3926 Dashwood,
3927 the
3928 legal
3929 inheritor
3930 of
3931 the
3932 Norland
3933 estate,
3934 and
3935 the
3936 person
3937 to
3938 whom
3939 he
3940 intended
3941 to
3942 bequeath
3943 it.
3944 In
3945 the
3946 society
3947 of
3948 his
3949 nephew
3950 and
3951 niece,
3952 and
3953 their
3954 children,
3955 the
3956 old
3957 Gentleman's
3958 days
3959 were
3960 comfortably
3961 spent.
3962 His
3963 attachment
3964 to
3965 them
3966 all
3967 increased.
3968 The
3969 constant
3970 attention
3971 of
3972 Mr.
3973 and
3974 Mrs.
3975 Henry
3976 Dashwood
3977 to
3978 his
3979 wishes,
3980 which
3981 proceeded
3982 not
3983 merely
3984 from
3985 interest,
3986 but
3987 from
3988 goodness
3989 of
3990 heart,
3991 gave
3992 him
3993 every
3994 degree
3995 of
3996 solid
3997 comfort
3998 which
3999 his
4000 age
4001 could
4002 receive;
4003 and
4004 the
4005 cheerfulness
4006 of
4007 the
4008 children
4009 added
4010 a
4011 relish
4012 to
4013 his
4014 existence.
4015 By
4016 a
4017 former
4018 marriage,
4019 Mr.
4020 Henry
4021 Dashwood
4022 had
4023 one
4024 son:
4025 by
4026 his
4027 present
4028 lady,
4029 three
4030 daughters.
4031 The
4032 son,
4033 a
4034 steady
4035 respectable
4036 young
4037 man,
4038 was
4039 amply
4040 provided
4041 for
4042 by
4043 the
4044 fortune
4045 of
4046 his
4047 mother,
4048 which
4049 had
4050 been
4051 large,
4052 and
4053 half
4054 of
4055 which
4056 devolved
4057 on
4058 him
4059 on
4060 his
4061 coming
4062 of
4063 age.
4064 By
4065 his
4066 own
4067 marriage,
4068 likewise,
4069 which
4070 happened
4071 soon
4072 afterwards,
4073 he
4074 added
4075 to
4076 his
4077 wealth.
4078 To
4079 him
4080 therefore
4081 the
4082 succession
4083 to
4084 the
4085 Norland
4086 estate
4087 was
4088 not
4089 so
4090 really
4091 important
4092 as
4093 to
4094 his
4095 sisters;
4096 for
4097 their
4098 fortune,
4099 independent
4100 of
4101 what
4102 might
4103 arise
4104 to
4105 them
4106 from
4107 their
4108 father's
4109 inheriting
4110 that
4111 property,
4112 could
4113 be
4114 but
4115 small.
4116 Their
4117 mother
4118 had
4119 nothing,
4120 and
4121 their
4122 father
4123 only
4124 seven
4125 thousand
4126 pounds
4127 in
4128 his
4129 own
4130 disposal;
4131 for
4132 the
4133 remaining
4134 moiety
4135 of
4136 his
4137 first
4138 wife's
4139 fortune
4140 was
4141 also
4142 secured
4143 to
4144 her
4145 child,
4146 and
4147 he
4148 had
4149 only
4150 a
4151 life
4152 interest
4153 in
4154 it.
4155 <docid 13>
4156 She
4157 asks
4158 Merle,
4159 her
4160 Maltese,
4161 Why
4162 must
4163 man's
4164 vocation
4165 always
4166 be
4167 to
4168 distinguish
4169 himself
4170 from
4171 animals?
4172 Is
4173 man's
4174 existence
4175 an
4176 end
4177 for
4178 which
4179 he
4180 must
4181 find
4182 the
4183 means?
4184 Sliding
4185 back
4186 the
4187 curtain
4188 on
4189 the
4190 sidelight
4191 of
4192 the
4193 door
4194 a
4195 little,
4196 Karen
4197 B
4198 critiques
4199 the
4200 notion
4201 of
4202 production
4203 of
4204 subsistence:
4205 it
4206 is
4207 the
4208 instrumentalization
4209 of
4210 nature.
4211 She
4212 summons
4213 up
4214 Marx:
4215 Labor
4216 is,
4217 in
4218 the
4219 first
4220 place,
4221 a
4222 process
4223 in
4224 which
4225 both
4226 man
4227 and
4228 nature
4229 participate,
4230 and
4231 in
4232 which
4233 man
4234 of
4235 his
4236 own
4237 accord
4238 starts,
4239 regulates
4240 and
4241 controls
4242 the
4243 material
4244 re-actions
4245 between
4246 himself
4247 and
4248 nature.
4249 He
4250 opposes
4251 himself
4252 to
4253 nature
4254 as
4255 one
4256 of
4257 her
4258 own
4259 forces,
4260 setting
4261 in
4262 motion
4263 arms
4264 and
4265 legs,
4266 head
4267 and
4268 hands,
4269 the
4270 natural
4271 forces
4272 of
4273 his
4274 body,
4275 in
4276 order
4277 to
4278 appropriate
4279 nature's
4280 productions
4281 in
4282 a
4283 form
4284 adapted
4285 to
4286 his
4287 own
4288 wants.
4289 How
4290 tedious,
4291 Karen
4292 sighs.
4293 Why
4294 can't
4295 these
4296 men
4297 see
4298 that
4299 labor
4300 is
4301 not
4302 the
4303 basis
4304 of
4305 human
4306 existence?
4307 Even
4308 Marcuse,
4309 for
4310 all
4311 his
4312 slavering
4313 after
4314 erotic
4315 freedom,
4316 says
4317 labor
4318 is
4319 grounded
4320 in
4321 an
4322 essential
4323 excess
4324 of
4325 human
4326 existence
4327 beyond
4328 every
4329 possible
4330 situation
4331 in
4332 which
4333 it
4334 finds
4335 itself
4336 and
4337 the
4338 world.
4339 It
4340 is
4341 necessary
4342 and
4343 eternally
4344 earlier
4345 than
4346 play:
4347 it
4348 is
4349 the
4350 starting
4351 point,
4352 foundation
4353 and
4354 principle
4355 of
4356 play
4357 insofar
4358 as
4359 play
4360 is
4361 precisely
4362 a
4363 breaking
4364 off
4365 from
4366 labor
4367 and
4368 a
4369 recuperation
4370 for
4371 labor.
4372 But
4373 that
4374 is
4375 so
4376 wrong!
4377 Taking
4378 her
4379 own
4380 version
4381 of
4382 luxury
4383 in
4384 an
4385 Henri
4386 III
4387 straight-back
4388 wooden
4389 chair,
4390 Karen
4391 tightens
4392 her
4393 black
4394 toque
4395 and
4396 murmurs,
4397 Marx
4398 doesn't
4399 see
4400 that
4401 in
4402 his
4403 symbolic
4404 exchanges
4405 primitive
4406 man
4407 does
4408 not
4409 gauge
4410 himself
4411 in
4412 relation
4413 to
4414 Nature.
4415 He
4416 is
4417 not
4418 aware
4419 of
4420 Necessity,
4421 a
4422 Law
4423 that
4424 takes
4425 effect
4426 only
4427 with
4428 the
4429 objectification
4430 of
4431 Nature.
4432 Primitive
4433 society
4434 does
4435 not
4436 exist
4437 as
4438 an
4439 instance
4440 apart
4441 from
4442 symbolic
4443 exchange;
4444 and
4445 this
4446 exchange
4447 never
4448 results
4449 from
4450 an
4451 excess
4452 of
4453 production.
4454 It
4455 is
4456 the
4457 opposite:
4458 to
4459 the
4460 extent
4461 that
4462 these
4463 terms
4464 apply
4465 here,
4466 subsistence
4467 and
4468 economic
4469 exchange
4470 are
4471 the
4472 residue
4473 of
4474 symbolic
4475 exchange,
4476 a
4477 remainder.
4478 Impatiently
4479 re-telling
4480 her
4481 jet
4482 beads,
4483 she
4484 thinks,
4485 survival
4486 is
4487 not
4488 a
4489 principle.
4490 We
4491 have
4492 made
4493 it
4494 one.
4495 She
4496 remembers
4497 Africa
4498 and
4499 her
4500 other
4501 lover,
4502 Jean
4503 Baudrillard,
4504 saying
4505 For
4506 the
4507 primitives,
4508 eating,
4509 drinking,
4510 and
4511 living
4512 are
4513 first
4514 of
4515 all
4516 acts
4517 that
4518 are
4519 exchanged:
4520 if
4521 they
4522 are
4523 not
4524 exchanged,
4525 they
4526 do
4527 not
4528 occur.
4529 It
4530 is
4531 symbolic
4532 exchange,
4533 where
4534 the
4535 relation
4536 is
4537 tied,
4538 and
4539 this
4540 exchange
4541 excludes
4542 any
4543 surplus:
4544 anything
4545 that
4546 cannot
4547 be
4548 exchanged
4549 or
4550 symbolically
4551 shared
4552 would
4553 break
4554 the
4555 reciprocity
4556 and
4557 institute
4558 power.
4559 Better
4560 yet,
4561 this
4562 exchange
4563 excludes
4564 all
4565 production.
4566 <docid 14>
4567 Kip
4568 Turner
4569 was
4570 bored
4571 in
4572 math
4573 class.
4574 He
4575 was
4576 bored
4577 at
4578 school
4579 most
4580 of
4581 the
4582 time.
4583 He
4584 was
4585 good
4586 at
4587 it
4588 without
4589 trying.
4590 He
4591 didn't
4592 need
4593 to
4594 be
4595 the
4596 best.
4597 He
4598 just
4599 needed
4600 to
4601 get
4602 an
4603 eighty
4604 percent
4605 average
4606 and
4607 his
4608 parents
4609 would
4610 let
4611 him
4612 play
4613 sports.
4614 He
4615 could
4616 manage
4617 that
4618 without
4619 too
4620 much
4621 effort.
4622 He
4623 raised
4624 his
4625 hand.
4626 Mr.
4627 Parker
4628 sighed.
4629 Yes,
4630 Mr.
4631 Turner.
4632 Can
4633 I
4634 have
4635 a
4636 hall
4637 pass?
4638 Mr.
4639 Parker
4640 looked
4641 annoyed.
4642 Kip
4643 took
4644 a
4645 hall
4646 pass
4647 for
4648 a
4649 bathroom
4650 break
4651 everyday.
4652 I'm
4653 done
4654 the
4655 assignment.
4656 The
4657 teacher's
4658 shoulders
4659 dropped
4660 and
4661 he
4662 waved
4663 Kip
4664 to
4665 the
4666 front
4667 of
4668 the
4669 room.
4670 On
4671 the
4672 way
4673 to
4674 the
4675 bathroom
4676 his
4677 eye
4678 was
4679 caught
4680 by
4681 a
4682 bulletin
4683 board
4684 set
4685 up
4686 in
4687 front
4688 of
4689 the
4690 English
4691 room.
4692 It
4693 wasn't
4694 his
4695 English
4696 class
4697 that
4698 was
4699 on
4700 his
4701 display,
4702 he
4703 felt
4704 relief.
4705 He
4706 didn't
4707 want
4708 his
4709 crap
4710 on
4711 display
4712 for
4713 the
4714 entire
4715 school.
4716 He
4717 read
4718 an
4719 uninspired,
4720 regurgitated
4721 essay
4722 and
4723 rolled
4724 his
4725 eyes.
4726 He
4727 glanced
4728 up
4729 at
4730 the
4731 title
4732 in
4733 bold,
4734 pink
4735 and
4736 blue
4737 letters,
4738 My
4739 Future
4740 Plans.
4741 He
4742 was
4743 going
4744 to
4745 move
4746 away,
4747 go
4748 back
4749 to
4750 class,
4751 but
4752 another
4753 poster
4754 drew
4755 his
4756 eye.
4757 The
4758 writer
4759 had
4760 meticulous
4761 handwriting
4762 and
4763 had
4764 written
4765 far
4766 more
4767 than
4768 anyone
4769 else.
4770 He
4771 glanced
4772 at
4773 the
4774 attached
4775 picture
4776 of
4777 a
4778 young
4779 girl
4780 with
4781 a
4782 pile
4783 of
4784 stuffed
4785 animals
4786 on
4787 her
4788 bed.
4789 She
4790 was
4791 holding
4792 a
4793 stick
4794 and
4795 pointing
4796 at
4797 something
4798 out
4799 of
4800 the
4801 picture
4802 behind
4803 her.
4804 Intrigued
4805 by
4806 the
4807 story
4808 behind
4809 the
4810 picture
4811 and
4812 what
4813 someone
4814 could
4815 be
4816 planning
4817 so
4818 thoroughly,
4819 Kip
4820 began
4821 to
4822 read.

4824 My
4825 Future
4826 Plans
4827 by
4828 Mandy
4829 Green
4830 My
4831 Great-Grandmother
4832 was
4833 a
4834 teacher.
4835 I
4836 didn't
4837 know
4838 her,
4839 unfortunately.
4840 But,
4841 my
4842 grandmother
4843 still
4844 tells
4845 me
4846 stories
4847 her
4848 mother
4849 told
4850 her
4851 about
4852 teaching
4853 in
4854 a
4855 one
4856 room
4857 school
4858 house.
4859 That
4860 sounded
4861 really
4862 great
4863 to
4864 me
4865 and
4866 I
4867 set
4868 up
4869 my
4870 own
4871 one
4872 room
4873 school
4874 house
4875 in
4876 my
4877 bedroom.
4878 Ever
4879 since
4880 I
4881 was
4882 five
4883 I
4884 wanted
4885 to
4886 be
4887 a
4888 teacher.
4889 I
4890 used
4891 to
4892 line
4893 up
4894 my
4895 stuffed
4896 animals
4897 in
4898 rows
4899 and
4900 teach
4901 them
4902 whatever
4903 it
4904 was
4905 I
4906 happened
4907 to
4908 be
4909 studying.
4910 But,
4911 I
4912 always
4913 tried
4914 to
4915 make
4916 it
4917 more
4918 exciting
4919 than
4920 my
4921 teachers
4922 had.
4923 I
4924 don't
4925 know
4926 if
4927 I
4928 succeeded,
4929 but
4930 it
4931 did
4932 succeed
4933 in
4934 making
4935 me
4936 a
4937 better
4938 student.
4939 Thus
4940 proving
4941 that
4942 teaching
4943 someone
4944 else
4945 something
4946 is
4947 the
4948 best
4949 way
4950 to
4951 learn.
4952 Throughout
4953 my
4954 school
4955 career,
4956 as
4957 a
4958 student,
4959 I've
4960 had
4961 exciting
4962 teachers
4963 and
4964 I've
4965 had
4966 boring
4967 teachers.
4968 The
4969 teachers
4970 who
4971 are
4972 excited
4973 are
4974 the
4975 ones
4976 who
4977 care
4978 about
4979 the
4980 students
4981 and
4982 the
4983 subject
4984 matter.
4985 I
4986 once
4987 had
4988 a
4989 teacher
4990 who
4991 didn't
4992 just
4993 teach
4994 us
4995 subject
4996 lessons.
4997 Her
4998 lessons
4999 went
5000 beyond
5001 the
5002 classroom.
5003 Her
5004 caring
5005 went
5006 beyond
5007 the
5008 school
5009 yard.
5010 She
5011 helped
5012 many
5013 of
5014 her
5015 students
5016 out
5017 of
5018 what
5019 felt
5020 like
5021 hopeless
5022 situations.
5023 She
5024 gave
5025 us
5026 confidence
5027 to
5028 tackle
5029 our
5030 lessons
5031 inside
5032 the
5033 classroom.
5034 We
5035 carried
5036 that
5037 confidence
5038 into
5039 the
5040 world.
5041 I
5042 want
5043 to
5044 pass
5045 her
5046 spirit
5047 onto
5048 others
5049 as
5050 it
5051 was
5052 given
5053 to
5054 me.
5055 I
5056 had
5057 another
5058 teacher
5059 who
5060 made
5061 lessons
5062 come
5063 alive.
5064 If
5065 we
5066 were
5067 studying
5068 Nfractions
5069 in
5070 math,
5071 we
5072 were
5073 measuring.
5074 If
5075 we
5076 were
5077 studying
5078 a
5079 story,
5080 we
5081 were
5082 making
5083 it
5084 into
5085 a
5086 play.
5087 I
5088 want
5089 to
5090 teach
5091 children
5092 that
5093 even
5094 the
5095 most
5096 boring
5097 of
5098 subjects,
5099 like
5100 History,
5101 can
5102 be
5103 exciting.
5104 These
5105 are
5106 just
5107 some
5108 of
5109 the
5110 reasons
5111 I
5112 am
5113 going
5114 to
5115 be
5116 a
5117 teacher.
5118 I
5119 want
5120 to
5121 show
5122 someone
5123 all
5124 their
5125 potential
5126 as
5127 it
5128 has
5129 been
5130 shown
5131 to
5132 me.
5133 <docid 16>
5134 Is
5135 he
5136 here
5137 yet?
5138 No.
5139 You
5140 scared
5141 him.
5142 I
5143 gotta
5144 take
5145 a
5146 massive
5147 piss.
5148 Dude,
5149 any
5150 excuse
5151 for
5152 you
5153 to
5154 pull
5155 that
5156 thing
5157 out.
5158 Anyone
5159 got
5160 any
5161 beer?
5162 We
5163 finished
5164 them
5165 all
5166 back
5167 at
5168 school.
5169 Besides,
5170 you
5171 have
5172 had
5173 enough.
5174 I
5175 have
5176 got
5177 one.
5178 It's
5179 not
5180 cold,
5181 but
5182 it
5183 is
5184 yours
5185 if
5186 you
5187 want
5188 it.
5189 All
5190 you
5191 gotta
5192 do
5193 is
5194 sit
5195 up,
5196 beg,
5197 roll
5198 over
5199 and
5200 shake
5201 that
5202 booty.
5203 Thanks
5204 a
5205 lot,
5206 Eric.
5207 Anytime,
5208 anywhere.
5209 This
5210 is
5211 gonna
5212 be
5213 sweet.
5214 I
5215 am
5216 glad
5217 I
5218 thought
5219 of
5220 it.
5221 You're
5222 animals.
5223 Just
5224 because
5225 he's
5226 new.
5227 You've
5228 talked
5229 shit
5230 the
5231 whole
5232 time.
5233 Why
5234 don't
5235 you
5236 be
5237 quiet?
5238 You
5239 know
5240 how
5241 it
5242 is.
5243 Nobody's
5244 forcing
5245 him
5246 to
5247 show
5248 up.
5249 What
5250 if
5251 he
5252 doesn't?
5253 I
5254 want
5255 to
5256 go
5257 back
5258 to
5259 the
5260 dance.
5261 Belinda,
5262 why
5263 don't
5264 you
5265 go
5266 back
5267 to
5268 the
5269 dance
5270 by
5271 yourself?
5272 I
5273 wasn't
5274 talking
5275 to
5276 you,
5277 Dean.
5278 You
5279 know
5280 I
5281 don't
5282 dance.
5283 It's
5284 true.
5285 I've
5286 seen
5287 him
5288 bust
5289 a
5290 move.
5291 It
5292 ain't
5293 pretty.
5294 But
5295 a
5296 brother
5297 like
5298 me
5299 is
5300 ready
5301 to
5302 get
5303 his
5304 freak
5305 on.
5306 What
5307 you
5308 say?
5309 Put
5310 it
5311 away
5312 before
5313 you
5314 hurt
5315 somebody.
5316 Like
5317 yourself.
5318 He's

5919 It's

5921 <docid 18>
5922 I
5923 knew
5924 this
5925 was
5926 coming.
5927 Cause
5928 when
5929 your
5930 fingers
5931 dial,
5932 those
5933 seven
5934 little
5935 numbers,
5936 it
5937 really
5938 turns
5939 me
5940 on.
5941 Is
5942 that
5943 the
5944 best
5945 you

5948 up
5949 with?
5950 Yeah.
5951 Wow.
5952 You
5953 are
5954 fast.
5955 Who
5956 was
5957 it?
5958 I
5959 don't
5960 know.
5961 It
5962 doesn't
5963 even
5964 say
5965 where
5966 it's
5967 from.
5968 Well,
5969 there's
5970 one
5971 way
5972 to
5973 find
5974 out.
5975 Oh,
5976 Jamie,
5977 you
5978 adopted
5979 us
5980 a
5981 baby.
5982 A
5983 baby?
5984 Have
5985 you
5986 seen
5987 this
5988 thing?
5989 Well,
5990 who
5991 would
5992 send
5993 you
5994 a
5995 doll?
5996 I
5997 have
5998 no
5999 idea.
6000 There's
6001 no
6002 card,
6003 no
6004 note.
6005 His
6006 eyes
6007 look
6008 so
6009 real.
6010 I
6011 don't
6012 know
6013 about
6014 you,
6015 but
6016 Lisa's
6017 hungry
6018 for
6019 Chinese.
6020 I
6021 think
6022 my
6023 wife's
6024 gone
6025 crazy.
6026 Oh,
6027 my
6028 God!
6029 This
6030 reminds
6031 me
6032 of
6033 that
6034 poem
6035 from
6036 when
6037 we
6038 were
6039 kids.
6040 What
6041 poem?
6042 You
6043 remember.
6044 Come
6045 on.
6046 That
6047 old
6048 ghost
6049 story
6050 about
6051 the
6052 woman
6053 who
6054 had
6055 all
6056 those
6057 dolls.
6058 Beware
6059 the
6060 stare
6061 of
6062 Mary
6063 Shaw.
6064 She
6065 had
6066 no
6067 children,
6068 only
6069 dolls.
6070 And
6071 something,
6072 something
6073 scary.
6074 Something,
6075 something.Boo!
6076 I
6077 think
6078 you're
6079 having
6080 just
6081 a
6082 little
6083 too
6084 much
6085 fun
6086 there,
6087 Lise.
6088 Oh,
6089 baby,
6090 I
6091 won't
6092 let
6093 the
6094 scary
6095 dummy
6096 hurt
6097 you.
6098 Thank
6099 you.
6100 Thank
6101 you.
6102 If
6103 you
6104 get
6105 Jamie
6106 to
6107 scream.
6108 I'll
6109 make
6110 sure
6111 you
6112 get
6113 seven
6114 minutes
6115 in
6116 heaven
6117 with
6118 my
6119 old
6120 Barbie.
6121 Deal?
6122 Yes,
6123 Lisa.
6124 God,
6125 I'm
6126 such
6127 a
6128 loser.
6129 Good
6130 boy.
6131 Jamie?
6132 Jamie?
6133 Baby,
6134 I'm
6135 back.
6136 Lisa!
6137 What
6138 are
6139 you
6140 trying
6141 to
6142 do?
6143 Burn
6144 the
6145 place
6146 down?
6147 Lise?
6148 Oh,
6149 Lisa.
6150 I'm
6151 in
6152 here.
6153 Dinner
6154 in
6155 bed
6156 again.
6157 Lisa!
6158 Yes,
6159 Jamie?
6160 What's
6161 going
6162 on?
6163 I
6164 have
6165 a
6166 surprise
6167 for
6168 you,
6169 Jamie.
6170 MARY
6171 SHAW:
6172 for
6173 you,
6174 Jamie.
6175 Lisa,
6176 this
6177 is
6178 not
6179 funny!
6180 You
6181 know
6182 what
6183 it
6184 was?
6185 Your
6186 mistake?
6187 It
6188 was
6189 the
6190 rose.
6191 Yep.
6192 Boy,
6193 I'll
6194 tell
6195 you
6196 if
6197 I
6198 had
6199 a
6200 dollar
6201 for
6202 every
6203 time
6204 some
6205 guy
6206 gave
6207 his
6208 wife
6209 a
6210 rose
6211 on
6212 the
6213 day
6214 that
6215 he,
6216 you
6217 know.
6218 Like
6219 that's
6220 an
6221 alibi.
6222 Alibi?
6223 I
6224 didn't
6225 hear
6226 you.
6227 Did
6228 you
6229 say
6230 something?
6231 Why
6232 would
6233 I
6234 need
6235 an
6236 alibi?
6237 I'm
6238 sure
6239 your
6240 lawyer
6241 would
6242 want
6243 you
6244 to
6245 have
6246 one.
6247 My
6248 lawyer?
6249 Yeah.
6250 I
6251 mean,
6252 the
6253 prosecution,
6254 they're
6255 going
6256 to
6257 have
6258 your
6259 fingerprints,
6260 no
6261 signs
6262 of
6263 forced
6264 entry
6265 on
6266 your
6267 apartment,
6268 and
6269 you
6270 as
6271 the
6272 last
6273 person
6274 to
6275 see
6276 your
6277 wife
6278 alive.
6279 I
6280 mean,
6281 that's
6282 a
6283 lot
6284 to
6285 go
6286 up
6287 against.
6288 You
6289 think
6290 I
6291 killed
6292 my
6293 wife?
6294 Excuse
6295 me?
6296 Do
6297 you
6298 think
6299 I
6300 killed
6301 my
6302 wife?
6303 No.
6304 No,
6305 I
6306 don't
6307 think
6308 you
6309 did.
6310 I'm
6311 just
6312 trying
6313 to
6314 help
6315 your
6316 lawyer
6317 out.
6318 I
6319 mean,
6320 he's
6321 going
6322 to
6323 need
6324 something
6325 more
6326 concrete.
6327 I
6328 mean,
6329 at
6330 least
6331 to
6332 shift
6333 the
6334 suspicion
6335 away
6336 from
6337 you.
6338 Suspicion?
6339 I
6340 mean,
6341 if
6342 you
6343 want
6344 to
6345 talk
6346 suspicion,
6347 why
6348 don't
6349 you
6350 start
6351 by
6352 looking
6353 at
6354 the
6355 package
6356 that
6357 turned
6358 up
6359 on
6360 my
6361 doorstep?
6362 Oh,
6363 yeah.
6364 That
6365 package,
6366 right.
6367 Let's
6368 see.
6369 You
6370 received
6371 an
6372 unmarked
6373 package.
6374 just
6375 moments
6376 before
6377 Lisa
6378 was
6379 killed.
6380 Yeah.
6381 A
6382 package
6383 containing
6384 a
6385 ventriloquist
6386 dummy.
6387 Ventriloquist
6388 dummy.
6389 Yeah.
6390 Well,
6391 the
6392 mystery
6393 toy
6394 department
6395 is
6396 down
6397 the
6398 hall.
6399 This
6400 is
6401 the
6402 homicide
6403 department.
6404 So
6405 unless
6406 you
6407 can
6408 tell
6409 me
6410 how
6411 some
6412 puppet
6413 ties
6414 into
6415 your
6416 wife's
6417 murder,
6418 I
6419 don't
6420 see
6421 the
6422 relevance.
6423 In
6424 the
6425 town
6426 where
6427 I'm
6428 from
6429 a
6430 ventriloquist
6431 dummy
6432 is
6433 a
6434 bad
6435 omen.
6436 It's
6437 kind
6438 of
6439 a
6440 local
6441 legend,
6442 and
6443 some
6444 people
6445 believe
6446 that
6447 the
6448 dummy
6449 brings
6450 death
6451 to
6452 those
6453 around
6454 them.
6455 <docid 19>
6456 I
6457 believe
6458 in
6459 America.
6460 America
6461 has
6462 made
6463 my
6464 fortune.
6465 And
6466 I
6467 raised
6468 my
6469 daughter
6470 in
6471 the
6472 American
6473 fashion.
6474 I
6475 gave
6476 her
6477 freedom,
6478 but
6479 I
6480 taught
6481 her
6482 never
6483 to
6484 dishonour
6485 her
6486 family.
6487 She
6488 found
6489 a
6490 boyfriend,
6491 not
6492 an
6493 Italian.
6494 She
6495 went
6496 to
6497 the
6498 movies
6499 with
6500 him.
6501 She
6502 stayed
6503 out
6504 late.
6505 I
6506 didn't
6507 protest.
6508 Two
6509 months
6510 ago
6511 he
6512 took
6513 her
6514 for
6515 a
6516 drive
6517 with
6518 another
6519 boyfriend.
6520 They
6521 made
6522 her
6523 drink
6524 whiskey...and
6525 then
6526 they
6527 tried
6528 to
6529 take
6530 advantage
6531 of
6532 her.
6533 She
6534 resisted,
6535 she
6536 kept
6537 her
6538 honour.
6539 So
6540 they
6541 beat
6542 her
6543 like
6544 an
6545 animal.
6546 When
6547 I
6548 went
6549 to
6550 the
6551 hospital,her
6552 nose
6553 was
6554 broken
6555 her
6556 jaw
6557 was
6558 shattered,
6559 held
6560 together
6561 by
6562 wire.
6563 She
6564 couldn't
6565 even
6566 weep
6567 because
6568 of
6569 the
6570 pain.
6571 But
6572 I
6573 wept.
6574 Why
6575 did
6576 I
6577 weep?
6578 She
6579 was
6580 the
6581 light
6582 of
6583 my
6584 life.
6585 Beautiful
6586 girl.
6587 Now
6588 she
6589 will
6590 never
6591 be
6592 beautiful
6593 again.
6594 Sorry.
6595 I
6596 went
6597 to
6598 the
6599 police,
6600 like
6601 a
6602 good
6603 American.
6604 These
6605 two
6606 boys
6607 were
6608 brought
6609 to
6610 trial.
6611 The
6612 judge
6613 sentenced
6614 them
6615 to
6616 three
6617 years
6618 in
6619 prison,
6620 but
6621 suspended
6622 the
6623 sentence.
6624 Suspended
6625 the
6626 sentence!
6627 They
6628 went
6629 free
6630 that
6631 very
6632 day!
6633 I
6634 stood
6635 in
6636 the
6637 courtroom
6638 like
6639 a
6640 fool.
6641 Those
6642 two
6643 bastards,
6644 they
6645 smiled
6646 at
6647 me.
6648 Then
6649 I
6650 said
6651 to
6652 my
6653 wife.
6654 For
6655 justice,
6656 we
6657 must
6658 go
6659 to
6660 Don
6661 Corleone.
6662 Why
6663 did
6664 you
6665 go
6666 to
6667 the
6668 police?
6669 Why
6670 didn't
6671 you
6672 come
6673 to
6674 me
6675 first?
6676 What
6677 do
6678 you
6679 want
6680 of
6681 me?
6682 Tell
6683 me
6684 anything,
6685 but
6686 do
6687 what
6688 I
6689 beg
6690 you
6691 to
6692 do.
6693 What
6694 is
6695 that?
6696 I
6697 want
6698 them
6699 dead.
6700 That
6701 I
6702 cannot
6703 do.
6704 I
6705 will
6706 give
6707 you
6708 anything
6709 you
6710 ask.
6711 I
6712 have
6713 known
6714 you
6715 many
6716 years,
6717 but
6718 this
6719 is
6720 the
6721 first
6722 time
6723 you've
6724 asked
6725 for
6726 help.
6727 I
6728 can't
6729 remember
6730 the
6731 last
6732 time
6733 you
6734 invited
6735 me
6736 for
6737 a
6738 cup
6739 of
6740 coffee.
6741 Even
6742 though
6743 my
6744 wife
6745 is
6746 god
6747 mother
6748 to
6749 your
6750 only
6751 child.
6752 But
6753 let's
6754 be
6755 frank
6756 here.
6757 You
6758 never
6759 wanted
6760 my
6761 friendship.
6762 And
6763 you
6764 were
6765 afraid
6766 to
6767 be
6768 in
6769 my
6770 debt.
6771 I
6772 didn't
6773 want
6774 to
6775 get
6776 into
6777 trouble.
6778 I
6779 understand.
6780 You
6781 found
6782 Paradise
6783 in
6784 America.
6785 You
6786 made
6787 a
6788 good
6789 living,
6790 had
6791 police
6792 protection
6793 and
6794 there
6795 were
6796 courts
6797 of
6798 law.
6799 You
6800 didn't
6801 need
6802 a
6803 friend
6804 like
6805 me.
6806 <docid 20>
6807 Watch
6808 It.
6809 Sorry
6810 Darling.
6811 Here
6812 you
6813 are.
6814 Thank
6815 you.
6816 Come
6817 here.
6818 Mind
6819 if
6820 I'll
6821 join
6822 you?
6823 I'll
6824 have
6825 the
6826 same.
6827 I
6828 should
6829 introduce
6830 myself.
6831 My
6832 name
6833 is
6834 Gandalf.
6835 Gandalf
6836 the
6837 Grey.
6838 I
6839 know
6840 who
6841 you
6842 are.
6843 Well,
6844 now,
6845 this
6846 is
6847 a
6848 fine
6849 chance.
6850 What
6851 brings
6852 Thorin
6853 Oakenshield
6854 to
6855 Bree?
6856 I
6857 received
6858 word
6859 that
6860 my
6861 Father
6862 had
6863 been
6864 seen
6865 wondering
6866 the
6867 wild
6868 near
6869 the
6870 Dunland.
6871 I
6872 went
6873 looking,
6874 found
6875 no
6876 sign
6877 of
6878 him.
6879 Thorin,
6880 it's
6881 Been
6882 a
6883 long
6884 time
6885 since
6886 anything
6887 but
6888 a
6889 rumour
6890 was
6891 heard
6892 of
6893 Thráin.
6894 He
6895 still
6896 lives.
6897 I'm
6898 sure
6899 of
6900 it.
6901 My
6902 father
6903 came
6904 to
6905 see
6906 you
6907 before
6908 he
6909 went
6910 missing.
6911 What
6912 did
6913 you
6914 say
6915 to
6916 him?
6917 I
6918 urged
6919 him
6920 to
6921 march
6922 upon
6923 Erebor.
6924 To
6925 destroy
6926 the
6927 dragon
6928 and
6929 take
6930 back
6931 lonely
6932 mountain.
6933 And
6934 I
6935 would
6936 say
6937 the
6938 same
6939 to
6940 you.
6941 Take
6942 back
6943 to
6944 your
6945 homeland.
6946 This
6947 is
6948 not
6949 a
6950 chance
6951 meeting.
6952 Is
6953 it,
6954 Gandalf?
6955 No.
6956 It
6957 is
6958 not.
6959 The
6960 lonely
6961 mountain
6962 troubles
6963 me,
6964 Thorin.
6965 That
6966 dragon
6967 has
6968 sit
6969 there
6970 long
6971 enough.
6972 Sooner
6973 or
6974 later
6975 darker
6976 minds
6977 will
6978 turn
6979 toward
6980 Erebor.
6981 I
6982 ran
6983 into
6984 some
6985 unsaviory
6986 characters
6987 whilist
6988 traveling
6989 along
6990 the
6991 Green
6992 way.
6993 One
6994 of
6995 them
6996 was
6997 carrying
6998 a
6999 message.
7000 This
7001 blacksmith.
7002 He
7003 promised
7004 as
7005 payment.
7006 For
7007 what?
7008 Your
7009 head.
7010 Someone
7011 wants
7012 you
7013 dead.
7014 You
7015 can
7016 wait
7017 no
7018 longer.
7019 You
7020 are
7021 the
7022 heir
7023 to
7024 the
7025 throne
7026 of
7027 Durin.
7028 Unite
7029 the
7030 armies
7031 of
7032 the
7033 dwarves.
7034 Together
7035 you
7036 have
7037 the
7038 might
7039 and
7040 power
7041 to
7042 retake
7043 Erebor.
7044 Summon
7045 a
7046 meeting
7047 of
7048 the
7049 seven
7050 dwarf
7051 families.
7052 Demand
7053 they
7054 stand
7055 by
7056 their
7057 oath.
7058 The
7059 seven
7060 armies
7061 swore
7062 that
7063 oath
7064 to
7065 the
7066 one
7067 who
7068 wields
7069 the
7070 king's
7071 jewel.
7072 The
7073 arkenstone.
7074 It
7075 is
7076 the
7077 only
7078 thing
7079 that
7080 will
7081 unite
7082 them
7083 and
7084 in
7085 case
7086 you
7087 have
7088 forgotten,
7089 that
7090 jewel
7091 was
7092 stolen
7093 by
7094 Smaug.
7095 What
7096 if
7097 I
7098 were
7099 to
7100 help
7101 you
7102 reclaim
7103 it?
7104 How?
7105 The
7106 arkenstone
7107 lies
7108 half
7109 a
7110 world
7111 away.
7112 Buried
7113 beneath
7114 the
7115 feet
7116 of
7117 a
7118 fire
7119 breathing
7120 dragon.
7121 Yes.
7122 That's
7123 right.
7124 Which
7125 is
7126 why
7127 we're
7128 going
7129 to
7130 need
7131 a
7132 burglar.
7133 12
7134 MONTHS
7135 LATER.
7136 Desolation
7137 of
7138 Smaug.
7139 How
7140 close
7141 to
7142 the
7143 pack?
7144 Too
7145 close.
7146 Couple
7147 of
7148 leagues,
7149 no
7150 more.
7151 But
7152 that's
7153 not
7154 the
7155 worst
7156 of
7157 it.
7158 Did
7159 the
7160 wolves
7161 pick
7162 up
7163 our
7164 scent?
7165 Not
7166 yet.
7167 But
7168 they
7169 will
7170 be.
7171 We
7172 have
7173 another
7174 problem.
7175 Did
7176 they
7177 see
7178 you?
7179 They
7180 saw
7181 you?
7182 No,
7183 that's
7184 not
7185 it.
7186 What
7187 did
7188 I
7189 tell
7190 you?
7191 Quiet
7192 as
7193 a
7194 mouse.
7195 Excellent
7196 burglar
7197 material.
7198 Will
7199 you
7200 just
7201 listen?

7203 As
7204 an
7205 introduction
7206 to
7207 the
7208 essay
7209 question
7210 posed
7211 a
7212 very
7213 brief
7214 and
7215 simplified
7216 summary
7217 of
7218 Habermas's
7219 main
7220 ideas
7221 and
7222 theories
7223 seems
7224 appropriate.
7225 Habermas
7226 argued
7227 that
7228 from
7229 the
7230 late
7231 nineteenth
7232 century
7233 science,
7234 technology
7235 and
7236 industry
7237 became
7238 interdependent
7239 forming
7240 a
7241 new
7242 kind
7243 of
7244 capitalism.
7245 Habermas
7246 viewed
7247 this
7248 interdependence
7249 as
7250 meaning
7251 capitalist
7252 growth
7253 had
7254 no
7255 limits
7256 because
7257 science
7258 and
7259 technology
7260 were
7261 the
7262 new
7263 leading
7264 productive
7265 forces.
7266 This
7267 new
7268 form
7269 of
7270 capitalism
7271 used
7272 a
7273 different
7274 kind
7275 of
7276 production
7277 and
7278 allowed
7279 the
7280 biblical
7281 curse
7282 of
7283 necessary
7284 labour,
7285 to
7286 be
7287 broken
7288 technologically.
7289 Originally
7290 capitalism
7291 had
7292 legitimated
7293 itself
7294 through
7295 economic
7296 notions
7297 of
7298 just
7299 exchange
7300 in
7301 the
7302 market,
7303 however
7304 due
7305 to
7306 the
7307 changes
7308 within
7309 capitalism,
7310 the
7311 exchange
7312 process
7313 itself
7314 now
7315 operated
7316 under
7317 political
7318 control.
7319 This
7320 new
7321 capitalism
7322 also
7323 required
7324 direct
7325 legitimation,
7326 this
7327 time
7328 using
7329 culture.
7330 Habermas
7331 argued
7332 that
7333 this
7334 led
7335 to
7336 a
7337 depoliticisation
7338 of
7339 society,
7340 which
7341 was
7342 legitimated
7343 by
7344 having
7345 technology
7346 and
7347 science
7348 also
7349 take
7350 on
7351 the
7352 role
7353 of
7354 an
7355 ideology.
7356 A
7357 Technocratic
7358 consciousness
7359 developed
7360 which
7361 affected
7362 everyone;
7363 not
7364 simply
7365 those
7366 repressed
7367 by
7368 the
7369 dominant.
7370 Habermas
7371 argued
7372 that
7373 there
7374 was
7375 no
7376 longer
7377 a
7378 lower
7379 class
7380 because
7381 everyone
7382 was
7383 now
7384 relatively
7385 rich.
7386 He
7387 argued
7388 there
7389 was
7390 no
7391 longer
7392 an
7393 exploited
7394 class,
7395 since
7396 technology
7397 was
7398 not
7399 dependent
7400 on
7401 labour;
7402 people
7403 were
7404 no
7405 longer
7406 forced
7407 to
7408 work,
7409 nor
7410 were
7411 they
7412 forcefully
7413 repressed
7414 in
7415 to
7416 their
7417 social
7418 positions.
7419 It
7420 is
7421 this
7422 universal,
7423 cultural
7424 phenomenon
7425 which
7426 Habermas's
7427 work
7428 focuses
7429 on
7430 and
7431 which
7432 replaces
7433 the
7434 Marxist
7435 questions
7436 of
7437 class
7438 conflict
7439 based
7440 on
7441 economic
7442 relations.
7443 In
7444 this
7445 essay
7446 I
7447 will
7448 argue
7449 that
7450 Habermas
7451 retains
7452 many
7453 aspects
7454 of
7455 Marxist
7456 theory
7457 in
7458 his
7459 work,
7460 in
7461 terms
7462 of
7463 some
7464 of
7465 the
7466 concepts
7467 he
7468 uses
7469 as
7470 well
7471 as
7472 the
7473 particular
7474 area
7475 of
7476 society
7477 he
7478 chooses
7479 to
7480 study.
7481 <docid 22>
7482 Older
7483 adults
7484 are
7485 frequently
7486 counseled
7487 to
7488 lose
7489 weight,
7490 even
7491 though
7492 there
7493 is
7494 little
7495 evidence
7496 that
7497 overweight
7498 is
7499 associated
7500 with
7501 increased
7502 mortality
7503 in
7504 those
7505 over
7506 age
7507 65.
7508 Six
7509 large
7510 controlled
7511 population
7512 based
7513 studies
7514 of
7515 non-smoking
7516 older
7517 adults
7518 have
7519 investigated
7520 the
7521 association
7522 between
7523 body
7524 mass
7525 index
7526 and
7527 mortality,
7528 controlling
7529 for
7530 relevant
7531 covariates.
7532 All
7533 studies
7534 found
7535 excess
7536 risk
7537 for
7538 persons
7539 with
7540 very
7541 low
7542 BMI,
7543 but
7544 that
7545 persons
7546 with
7547 moderately
7548 high
7549 BMI
7550 had
7551 little
7552 or
7553 no
7554 extra
7555 risk
7556 except
7557 in
7558 certain
7559 small
7560 subsets.
7561 A
7562 review
7563 of
7564 13
7565 studies
7566 of
7567 older
7568 adults
7569 drew
7570 similar
7571 conclusions.
7572 Many
7573 healthy
7574 older
7575 adults
7576 report
7577 gradual
7578 weight
7579 gain
7580 throughout
7581 adult
7582 life.
7583 It
7584 may
7585 be
7586 that
7587 a
7588 small
7589 amount
7590 of
7591 gradual
7592 weight
7593 gain
7594 is
7595 normative
7596 and
7597 associated
7598 with
7599 the
7600 most
7601 robust
7602 health
7603 as
7604 we
7605 age.
7606 It
7607 has
7608 been
7609 suggested
7610 that
7611 weight
7612 standards
7613 be
7614 adjusted
7615 upwards
7616 for
7617 age.
7618 Such
7619 recommendations
7620 remain
7621 controversial,
7622 however,
7623 because
7624 the
7625 number
7626 of
7627 studies
7628 of
7629 older
7630 persons
7631 is
7632 fairly
7633 small,
7634 and
7635 because
7636 few
7637 studies
7638 have
7639 examined
7640 the
7641 relation
7642 of
7643 BMI
7644 to
7645 quality
7646 of
7647 life
7648 or
7649 years
7650 of
7651 healthy
7652 life
7653 in
7654 the
7655 elderly.
7656 In
7657 older
7658 adults,
7659 risk
7660 factors
7661 may
7662 have
7663 a
7664 greater
7665 effect
7666 on
7667 health
7668 than
7669 on
7670 mortality.
7671 If
7672 so,
7673 then
7674 behavior
7675 change
7676 trials
7677 of
7678 weight
7679 modification
7680 might
7681 be
7682 more
7683 successful
7684 if
7685 they
7686 were
7687 evaluated
7688 on
7689 improved
7690 health,
7691 rather
7692 than
7693 on
7694 decreased
7695 mortality.
7696 Clinical
7697 trials
7698 powered
7699 to
7700 detect
7701 differences
7702 in
7703 YHL
7704 would
7705 often
7706 require
7707 fewer
7708 subjects
7709 than
7710 trials
7711 to
7712 detect
7713 survival
7714 differences
7715 or
7716 cardiovascular
7717 events.
7718 In
7719 this
7720 paper
7721 we
7722 study
7723 whether
7724 BMI
7725 at
7726 baseline
7727 is
7728 associated
7729 with
7730 living
7731 longer,
7732 and/or
7733 with
7734 more
7735 years
7736 of
7737 being
7738 healthy,
7739 in
7740 a
7741 cohort
7742 of
7743 older
7744 adults
7745 for
7746 whom
7747 risk
7748 factors,
7749 subclinical
7750 disease,
7751 and
7752 morbidity
7753 are
7754 well
7755 characterized.
7756 The
7757 goal
7758 is
7759 to
7760 determine
7761 whether
7762 analyses
7763 based
7764 on
7765 years
7766 of
7767 life
7768 or
7769 on
7770 YHL
7771 would
7772 provide
7773 substantively
7774 different
7775 results,
7776 and
7777 which
7778 measure
7779 would
7780 yield
7781 more
7782 powerful
7783 evaluations
7784 of
7785 weight
7786 modification
7787 interventions
7788 in
7789 older
7790 adults.
7791 <docid 23>
7792 As
7793 technology
7794 advances
7795 transport
7796 gets
7797 ever
7798 faster
7799 and
7800 trains
7801 are
7802 no
7803 exception,
7804 but
7805 with
7806 great
7807 speed
7808 come
7809 great
7810 drawbacks,
7811 Katia
7812 Moskvitch
7813 reports
7814 on
7815 the
7816 pitfalls
7817 facing
7818 train
7819 designers
7820 trying
7821 to
7822 reach
7823 even
7824 greater
7825 speed
7826 on
7827 rails.
7828 Since
7829 George
7830 Stephenson’s
7831 Rocket
7832 designers
7833 have
7834 been
7835 trying
7836 to
7837 make
7838 trains
7839 go
7840 faster
7841 and
7842 faster.
7843 Despite
7844 all
7845 the
7846 innovations
7847 particularly
7848 in
7849 the
7850 last
7851 50
7852 years,
7853 it’s
7854 still
7855 a
7856 dream
7857 that
7858 all
7859 cities
7860 around
7861 the
7862 world
7863 could
7864 be
7865 connected
7866 by
7867 highspeed
7868 trains
7869 that
7870 complete
7871 journeys
7872 in
7873 a
7874 flash
7875 allowing
7876 you
7877 to
7878 arrive
7879 at
7880 your
7881 destination
7882 relaxed
7883 and
7884 untroubled.
7885 Why
7886 is
7887 this
7888 the
7889 case?
7890 Going
7891 fast
7892 on
7893 rails
7894 brings
7895 its
7896 own
7897 special
7898 set
7899 of
7900 problems.
7901 Human
7902 bodies
7903 are
7904 simply
7905 not
7906 built
7907 for
7908 rapid
7909 acceleration,
7910 we
7911 experience
7912 certain
7913 low
7914 frequency
7915 motions
7916 that
7917 create
7918 discomfort
7919 a
7920 feeling
7921 of
7922 motion
7923 sickness.
7924 We
7925 also
7926 experience
7927 rapid
7928 acceleration
7929 for
7930 example
7931 each
7932 time
7933 we
7934 take
7935 off
7936 and
7937 land
7938 in
7939 a
7940 plane.
7941 Then
7942 there
7943 is
7944 the
7945 logistics
7946 of
7947 trying
7948 to
7949 send
7950 a
7951 train
7952 faster
7953 along
7954 a
7955 track.
7956 Going
7957 fast
7958 means
7959 pushing
7960 air
7961 out
7962 of
7963 the
7964 way
7965 which
7966 also
7967 requires
7968 a
7969 lot
7970 of
7971 power.
7972 A
7973 train
7974 travelling
7975 at
7976 300mph
7977 480km/h
7978 uses
7979 roughly
7980 27
7981 times
7982 more
7983 power
7984 than
7985 one
7986 travelling
7987 at
7988 100mph
7989 160km/h,
7990 and
7991 at
7992 ground
7993 level
7994 the
7995 air
7996 is
7997 a
7998 lot
7999 denser
8000 than
8001 it
8002 is
8003 at
8004 35000ft
8005 10600m
8006 where
8007 airliners
8008 regularly
8009 cruise.
8010 That
8011 means
8012 more
8013 resistance
8014 and
8015 therefore
8016 more
8017 vibrations.
8018 But
8019 train
8020 operators
8021 and
8022 companies
8023 are
8024 pushing
8025 for
8026 evergreater
8027 speeds,
8028 and
8029 they
8030 have
8031 been
8032 trying
8033 out
8034 a
8035 range
8036 of
8037 innovative
8038 designs
8039 that
8040 they
8041 hope
8042 will
8043 make
8044 trains
8045 go
8046 superfast
8047 and
8048 be
8049 ultracomfortable
8050 at
8051 the
8052 same
8053 time.
8054 If
8055 trains
8056 could
8057 travel
8058 just
8059 in
8060 straight
8061 lines
8062 and
8063 without
8064 any
8065 dips
8066 then
8067 high
8068 speeds
8069 would
8070 not
8071 be
8072 a
8073 big
8074 issue.
8075 It’s
8076 the
8077 bends
8078 and
8079 the
8080 ups
8081 and
8082 downs
8083 that
8084 create
8085 a
8086 problem
8087 especially
8088 in
8089 Europe
8090 with
8091 its
8092 many
8093 rivers
8094 and
8095 mountains
8096 and
8097 old
8098 train
8099 lines
8100 following
8101 longtravelled
8102 routes.
8103 The
8104 first
8105 attempts
8106 to
8107 make
8108 trains
8109 tackle
8110 curves
8111 faster
8112 were
8113 made
8114 in
8115 the
8116 early
8117 1970s.
8118 When
8119 an
8120 old
8121 concept
8122 well
8123 known
8124 to
8125 motorcyclists
8126 leaning
8127 into
8128 the
8129 curve
8130 was
8131 first
8132 applied
8133 to
8134 rail
8135 travel,
8136 that
8137 led
8138 to
8139 the
8140 first
8141 tilting
8142 trains.
8143 The
8144 idea
8145 was
8146 that
8147 passengers
8148 will
8149 feel
8150 less
8151 of
8152 the
8153 centrifugal
8154 forces
8155 of
8156 a
8157 highspeed
8158 train
8159 going
8160 into
8161 a
8162 bend
8163 when
8164 the
8165 whole
8166 train
8167 itself
8168 leans
8169 into
8170 the
8171 curve.
8172 But
8173 with
8174 the
8175 first
8176 tilting
8177 trains
8178 and
8179 extra
8180 speed
8181 came
8182 great
8183 discomfort
8184 partly
8185 because
8186 of
8187 a
8188 trick
8189 the
8190 eyes
8191 play
8192 on
8193 the
8194 brain.
8195 If
8196 the
8197 tilting
8198 system
8199 is
8200 too
8201 good
8202 and
8203 you
8204 do
8205 not
8206 feel
8207 that
8208 you
8209 are
8210 going
8211 around
8212 a
8213 curve
8214 but
8215 you
8216 can
8217 see
8218 it
8219 such
8220 as
8221 the
8222 horizon
8223 changes
8224 when
8225 your
8226 brain
8227 does
8228 not
8229 expect
8230 it,
8231 it
8232 can
8233 make
8234 you
8235 feel
8236 queasy
8237 says
8238 James
8239 Kennell,
8240 a
8241 bogie

8250 We
8251 all
8252 know
8253 humans
8254 have
8255 a
8256 complex
8257 range
8258 of
8259 emotions
8260 from
8261 anger
8262 to
8263 fear
8264 aggression
8265 to
8266 happiness.
8267 For
8268 something
8269 so
8270 familiar
8271 to
8272 all
8273 of
8274 us
8275 it’s
8276 amazing
8277 how
8278 vexing
8279 and
8280 difficult
8281 a
8282 problem
8283 it
8284 still
8285 is
8286 in
8287 brain
8288 science.
8289 David
8290 Anderson
8291 professor
8292 of
8293 biology
8294 at
8295 California
8296 Institute
8297 for
8298 Technology,
8299 hopes
8300 this
8301 will
8302 change
8303 He
8304 believes
8305 his
8306 and
8307 other
8308 researchers’
8309 efforts
8310 will
8311 provide
8312 a
8313 much
8314 better
8315 understanding
8316 of
8317 what
8318 an
8319 emotion
8320 is
8321 in
8322 the
8323 brain.
8324 It
8325 has
8326 long
8327 been
8328 thought
8329 that
8330 the
8331 chemicals
8332 our
8333 bodies
8334 create
8335 largely
8336 regulate
8337 the
8338 way
8339 we
8340 feel,
8341 but
8342 Anderson
8343 thinks
8344 it
8345 could
8346 also
8347 be
8348 down
8349 to
8350 the
8351 wiring
8352 within
8353 our
8354 brains
8355 His
8356 experiments
8357 on
8358 mice
8359 and
8360 flies
8361 that
8362 switch
8363 on
8364 and
8365 off
8366 light
8367 sensitive
8368 neurons
8369 have
8370 shown
8371 that
8372 the
8373 neurons
8374 that
8375 control
8376 aggressive
8377 behaviour
8378 are
8379 the
8380 same
8381 or
8382 similar
8383 to
8384 the
8385 neurons
8386 that
8387 control
8388 sexual
8389 behaviour.
8390 It
8391 offers
8392 the
8393 intriguing
8394 notion
8395 that
8396 the
8397 neurons
8398 that
8399 control
8400 sex
8401 and
8402 violence
8403 are
8404 intimately
8405 linked
8406 or
8407 overlapping
8408 in
8409 the
8410 brain.
8411 It’s
8412 these
8413 and
8414 other
8415 insights
8416 in
8417 the
8418 field
8419 that
8420 are
8421 beginning
8422 to
8423 uncover
8424 how
8425 emotions
8426 are
8427 encoded
8428 in
8429 the
8430 brain.
8431 The
8432 hope
8433 is
8434 that
8435 these
8436 intriguing
8437 findings
8438 will
8439 also
8440 provide
8441 a
8442 better
8443 understanding
8444 of
8445 how
8446 an
8447 emotion
8448 can
8449 go
8450 wrong
8451 in
8452 psychiatric
8453 disorders
8454 like
8455 depression
8456 and
8457 how
8458 we
8459 can
8460 go
8461 about
8462 treating
8463 it.
8464 For
8465 Gallant
8466 and
8467 his
8468 lab,
8469 this
8470 was
8471 just
8472 another
8473 demonstration
8474 of
8475 their
8476 technology.
8477 While
8478 his
8479 device
8480 has
8481 made
8482 plenty
8483 of
8484 headlines
8485 he
8486 never
8487 actually
8488 set
8489 out
8490 to
8491 build
8492 a
8493 brain
8494 decoder.
8495 It
8496 was
8497 one
8498 of
8499 the
8500 coolest
8501 things
8502 we
8503 ever
8504 did,
8505 he
8506 says,
8507 but
8508 it’s
8509 not
8510 science.
8511 Gallant’s
8512 research
8513 focuses
8514 on
8515 figuring
8516 out
8517 how
8518 the
8519 visual
8520 system
8521 works
8522 creating
8523 models
8524 of
8525 how
8526 the
8527 brain
8528 processes
8529 visual
8530 information
8531 The
8532 brain
8533 reader
8534 was
8535 a
8536 side
8537 project
8538 a
8539 coincidental
8540 offshoot
8541 of
8542 his
8543 actual
8544 scientific
8545 research.
8546 It
8547 just
8548 so
8549 happens
8550 that
8551 if
8552 you
8553 build
8554 a
8555 really
8556 good
8557 model
8558 of
8559 the
8560 brain,
8561 then
8562 that
8563 turns
8564 out
8565 to
8566 be
8567 the
8568 best
8569 possible
8570 decoder.
8571 Science
8572 or
8573 not
8574 the
8575 machine
8576 strokes
8577 the
8578 dystopian
8579 futurists
8580 among
8581 people
8582 who
8583 fear
8584 that
8585 the
8586 government
8587 could
8588 one
8589 day
8590 tap
8591 into
8592 our
8593 innermost
8594 thoughts.
8595 This
8596 might
8597 seem
8598 like
8599 a
8600 silly
8601 fear
8602 but
8603 Gallant
8604 says
8605 it’s
8606 not.
8607 I
8608 actually
8609 agree
8610 that
8611 you
8612 should
8613 be
8614 afraid,
8615 he
8616 says,
8617 but
8618 you
8619 don’t
8620 have
8621 to
8622 be
8623 afraid
8624 for
8625 another
8626 50
8627 years
8628 It
8629 will
8630 take
8631 that
8632 long
8633 to
8634 solve
8635 two
8636 of
8637 the
8638 big
8639 challenges
8640 in
8641 brain
8642 reading
8643 technology:
8644 the
8645 portability
8646 and
8647 the
8648 strength
8649 of
8650 the
8651 signal.

8659 Frequent
8660 flyers
8661 are
8662 often
8663 on
8664 guard
8665 against
8666 sneezing
8667 or
8668 coughing
8669 co
8670 passengers
8671 in
8672 fear
8673 of
8674 catching
8675 what
8676 they
8677 have.
8678 And
8679 the
8680 possibility
8681 that
8682 much
8683 more
8684 serious
8685 epidemics
8686 or
8687 pandemics
8688 could
8689 spread
8690 by
8691 air
8692 travel
8693 has
8694 been
8695 a
8696 worry
8697 for
8698 years
8699 whether
8700 it
8701 is
8702 avian
8703 flu
8704 Sars
8705 or
8706 tuberculosis.
8707 Now
8708 we
8709 are
8710 in
8711 the
8712 middle
8713 of
8714 one
8715 of
8716 the
8717 deadliest
8718 outbreaks
8719 of
8720 Ebola
8721 virus
8722 ever
8723 the
8724 outbreak
8725 started
8726 in
8727 Guinea
8728 last
8729 March
8730 and
8731 soon
8732 reached
8733 Liberia,
8734 Sierra,
8735 Leone
8736 and
8737 Nigeria.
8738 Concern
8739 in
8740 the
8741 West
8742 has
8743 heightened
8744 after
8745 it
8746 emerged
8747 that
8748 a
8749 man
8750 had
8751 flown
8752 on
8753 internal
8754 flights
8755 while
8756 carrying
8757 the
8758 virus
8759 with
8760 fears
8761 growing
8762 that
8763 air
8764 travel
8765 could
8766 quickly
8767 carry
8768 the
8769 terrifying
8770 disease
8771 around
8772 the
8773 world
8774 British
8775 Prime
8776 Minister
8777 David
8778 Cameron
8779 described
8780 Ebola
8781 as
8782 a
8783 serious
8784 threat.
8785 The
8786 risks
8787 of
8788 catching
8789 an
8790 infection
8791 from
8792 an
8793 ill
8794 passenger
8795 are
8796 not
8797 as
8798 high
8799 as
8800 you
8801 would
8802 think,
8803 says
8804 Christine
8805 Pearson
8806 a
8807 spokesperson
8808 for
8809 the
8810 Centers

8816 CDC
8817 in

8819 Georgia.
8820 It’s
8821 not
8822 any
8823 more
8824 dangerous
8825 than
8826 any
8827 place
8828 where
8829 you
8830 are
8831 in
8832 touch
8833 with
8834 lots
8835 of
8836 people
8837 like
8838 a
8839 shopping
8840 mall
8841 food
8842 court
8843 for
8844 example.
8845 John
8846 Oxford
8847 a
8848 virologist
8849 at
8850 Queen
8851 Mary
8852 University
8853 London
8854 agrees.
8855 He
8856 points
8857 out
8858 that
8859 the
8860 aeroplane
8861 ventilation
8862 goes
8863 from
8864 the
8865 ground
8866 to
8867 the
8868 ceiling
8869 where
8870 the
8871 air
8872 is
8873 filtered
8874 for
8875 bacteria
8876 and
8877 viruses
8878 before
8879 it
8880 recirculates.
8881 Simulations
8882 looking
8883 at
8884 the
8885 potential
8886 spread
8887 of
8888 germs
8889 have
8890 found
8891 that
8892 they
8893 are
8894 generally
8895 confined
8896 to
8897 just
8898 a
8899 couple
8900 of
8901 rows
8902 either
8903 side
8904 of
8905 the
8906 carrier,
8907 even
8908 then
8909 the
8910 chances
8911 appear
8912 to
8913 be
8914 small
8915 according
8916 to
8917 a
8918 study
8919 published
8920 in
8921 the
8922 British
8923 Medical
8924 Journal.
8925 The
8926 paper
8927 looked
8928 at
8929 a
8930 flight
8931 involving
8932 nine
8933 school
8934 children
8935 who
8936 were
8937 later
8938 found
8939 to
8940 be
8941 carrying
8942 the
8943 swine
8944 flu
8945 virus,
8946 just
8947 two
8948 other
8949 passengers
8950 of
8951 more
8952 than
8953 100
8954 questioned
8955 later
8956 developed
8957 the
8958 illness
8959 and
8960 they
8961 were
8962 both
8963 sitting
8964 within
8965 two
8966 rows
8967 of
8968 the
8969 ill
8970 school
8971 kids.
8972 As
8973 a
8974 result,
8975 the
8976 researchers
8977 concluded
8978 that
8979 there
8980 was
8981 just
8982 a
8983 35%
8984 risk
8985 of
8986 catching
8987 the
8988 illness
8989 if
8990 you
8991 were
8992 sitting
8993 in
8994 those
8995 seats.
8996 A
8997 handful
8998 of
8999 other
9000 studies
9001 looking
9002 at
9003 measles
9004 and
9005 TB
9006 also
9007 suggest
9008 that
9009 in
9010 flight
9011 transmission
9012 rates
9013 are
9014 similarly
9015 low.
9016 From
9017 studies
9018 such
9019 as
9020 these
9021 Oxford
9022 says
9023 that
9024 the
9025 biggest
9026 risk
9027 is
9028 not
9029 on
9030 the
9031 plane
9032 but
9033 in
9034 the
9035 taxi
9036 on
9037 the
9038 way
9039 to
9040 the
9041 airport.
9042 If
9043 an
9044 apparently
9045 healthy
9046 person
9047 carrying
9048 the
9049 virus
9050 lands
9051 in
9052 a
9053 country
9054 there
9055 is
9056 still
9057 room
9058 for
9059 a
9060 second
9061 stage
9062 of
9063 contagion,
9064 this
9065 is
9066 perhaps
9067 the
9068 greater
9069 risk
9070 for
9071 a
9072 global
9073 epidemic
9074 undetected
9075 carriers
9076 are
9077 the
9078 way
9079 that
9080 swine
9081 flu
9082 and
9083 Sars
9084 spread
9085 across
9086 the
9087 world.
9088 The
9089 history
9090 of
9091 the
9092 spread
9093 of
9094 infectious
9095 diseases
9096 is
9097 infinitely
9098 entwined
9099 with
9100 improvements
9101 in
9102 travel
9103 says
9104 Edmunds.
9105 He
9106 points
9107 out
9108 that
9109 in
9110 the
9111 past
9112 the
9113 spread
9114 of
9115 diseases
9116 was
9117 limited
9118 by
9119 the
9120 length
9121 of
9122 travel
9123 measles
9124 develops
9125 quickly,
9126 so
9127 all
9128 the
9129 cases
9130 would
9131 have
9132 burnt
9133 out
9134 by
9135 the
9136 end
9137 of
9138 a
9139 long
9140 voyage
9141 Since
9142 Ebola
9143 has
9144 an
9145 incubation
9146 period
9147 of
9148 up
9149 to
9150 21
9151 days
9152 carriers
9153 could
9154 arrive
9155 in
9156 a
9157 country
9158 weeks
9159 before
9160 symptoms
9161 develop
9162 potentially
9163 transmitting
9164 it
9165 to
9166 the
9167 people
9168 they
9169 know.
9170 It
9171 is
9172 an
9173 issue
9174 admits
9175 Oxford
9176 but
9177 he
9178 is
9179 optimistic
9180 that
9181 the
9182 infection
9183 could
9184 still
9185 be
9186 contained.
9187 Anyone
9188 showing
9189 the
9190 symptoms
9191 would
9192 have
9193 a
9194 rapid
9195 diagnosis
9196 before
9197 being
9198 quarantined
9199 and
9200 health
9201 authorities
9202 would
9203 also
9204 check
9205 anyone
9206 who
9207 had
9208 been
9209 in
9210 contact
9211 with
9212 them
9213 such
9214 as
9215 air
9216 crews,
9217 passport
9218 officials
9219 and
9220 their
9221 families.
9222 All
9223 of
9224 that
9225 can
9226 stop
9227 it
9228 spreading
9229 and
9230 it
9231 will
9232 be
9233 stopped.

9235 If
9236 you
9237 are
9238 just
9239 setting
9240 up
9241 house
9242 you
9243 will
9244 need
9245 to
9246 keep
9247 some
9248 basic
9249 herbs
9250 and
9251 spices
9252 on
9253 hand
9254 to
9255 be
9256 prepared
9257 for
9258 any
9259 recipe
9260 Although
9261 those
9262 spice
9263 racks
9264 and
9265 turntables
9266 may
9267 be
9268 attractive
9269 and
9270 handy
9271 on
9272 your
9273 countertop
9274 it
9275 is
9276 best
9277 to
9278 store
9279 all
9280 herbs
9281 and
9282 spices
9283 in
9284 a
9285 cool
9286 dark
9287 place
9288 away
9289 from
9290 heat
9291 and
9292 light
9293 sources
9294 You
9295 can
9296 purchase
9297 inexpensive
9298 turntables
9299 to
9300 fit
9301 inside
9302 your
9303 cabinet
9304 for
9305 easier
9306 accessibility.
9307 Although
9308 herbs
9309 and
9310 spices
9311 will
9312 not
9313 go
9314 bad
9315 per
9316 se
9317 they
9318 will
9319 definitely
9320 lose
9321 their
9322 potency
9323 with
9324 age
9325 and
9326 seeds
9327 such
9328 as
9329 poppy
9330 and
9331 sesame
9332 will
9333 get
9334 rancid
9335 Most
9336 whole
9337 herbs
9338 and
9339 spices
9340 will
9341 retain
9342 their
9343 flavor
9344 about
9345 1
9346 year
9347 while
9348 dried
9349 and
9350 ground
9351 versions
9352 are
9353 best
9354 used
9355 within
9356 6
9357 months
9358 Dried
9359 herbs
9360 should
9361 be
9362 crushed
9363 between
9364 the
9365 palms
9366 of
9367 your
9368 hands
9369 to
9370 release
9371 their
9372 flavor
9373 before
9374 adding
9375 to
9376 recipes
9377 As
9378 a
9379 general
9380 rule
9381 for
9382 most
9383 herbs
9384 1
9385 teaspoon
9386 of
9387 dried
9388 herb
9389 may
9390 be
9391 substituted
9392 for
9393 1
9394 Tablespoon
9395 of
9396 chopped
9397 fresh
9398 herb.
9399 Here
9400 are
9401 some
9402 tips
9403 and
9404 hints
9405 for
9406 beating
9407 egg
9408 whites
9409 so
9410 your
9411 recipe
9412 works
9413 properly
9414 For
9415 beating
9416 egg
9417 whites
9418 until
9419 stiff
9420 use
9421 a
9422 small
9423 deep
9424 bowl
9425 with
9426 a
9427 rounded
9428 bottom
9429 for
9430 4
9431 to
9432 5
9433 egg
9434 whites
9435 or
9436 a
9437 large
9438 deep
9439 bowl
9440 for
9441 more
9442 You
9443 will
9444 get
9445 more
9446 volume
9447 when
9448 beating
9449 egg
9450 whites
9451 if
9452 you
9453 first
9454 bring
9455 them
9456 to
9457 room
9458 temperature
9459 You
9460 can
9461 bring
9462 egg
9463 whites
9464 to
9465 room
9466 temperature
9467 by
9468 setting
9469 the
9470 eggs
9471 out
9472 on
9473 your
9474 counter
9475 at
9476 least
9477 30
9478 minutes
9479 in
9480 advance
9481 of
9482 your
9483 preparation
9484 For
9485 a
9486 quick
9487 method
9488 place
9489 the
9490 eggs
9491 in
9492 a
9493 bowl
9494 of
9495 very
9496 warm
9497 but
9498 not
9499 hot
9500 water
9501 for
9502 5
9503 to
9504 10
9505 minutes
9506 If
9507 the
9508 eggs
9509 are
9510 already
9511 separated
9512 place
9513 the
9514 egg
9515 whites
9516 in
9517 a
9518 bowl
9519 in
9520 a
9521 pan
9522 of
9523 warm
9524 water.
9525 The
9526 bowl
9527 itself
9528 can
9529 make
9530 a
9531 very
9532 big
9533 difference
9534 when
9535 beating
9536 egg
9537 whites
9538 A
9539 copper
9540 bowl
9541 is
9542 ideal
9543 since
9544 it
9545 will
9546 react
9547 chemically
9548 with
9549 egg
9550 whites
9551 to
9552 form
9553 fluffy
9554 high
9555 peaks
9556 When
9557 using
9558 a
9559 stainless
9560 steel
9561 or
9562 glass
9563 bowl
9564 add
9565 cream
9566 of
9567 tartar
9568 or
9569 lemon
9570 juice
9571 to
9572 achieve
9573 the
9574 same
9575 result
9576 as
9577 with
9578 a
9579 copper
9580 bowl
9581 Avoid
9582 aluminum
9583 bowls
9584 which
9585 can
9586 cause
9587 whites
9588 to
9589 turn
9590 gray
9591 and
9592 wooden
9593 bowls
9594 which
9595 tend
9596 to
9597 absorb
9598 oils
9599 from
9600 other
9601 usages
9602 and
9603 can
9604 retard
9605 your
9606 whipped
9607 whites
9608 The
9609 addition
9610 of
9611 an
9612 acid
9613 will
9614 fluff
9615 up
9616 your
9617 whipped
9618 egg
9619 whites
9620 It
9621 stabilizes
9622 the
9623 whites
9624 and
9625 adds
9626 volume
9627 Add
9628 1/8
9629 teaspoon
9630 of
9631 acid
9632 ingredient
9633 such
9634 as
9635 lemon
9636 juice
9637 vinegar
9638 or
9639 cream
9640 of
9641 tartar
9642 per
9643 egg
9644 white
9645 meringues
9646 where
9647 1/8
9648 is
9649 used
9650 for
9651 two
9652 egg
9653 whites
9654 The
9655 acid
9656 should
9657 be
9658 added
9659 to
9660 the
9661 whites
9662 just
9663 as
9664 they
9665 begin
9666 to
9667 become
9668 frothy
9669 during
9670 beating.
9671 Egg
9672 whites
9673 beaten
9674 with
9675 sugar
9676 combined
9677 will
9678 not
9679 peak
9680 as
9681 firmly
9682 It
9683 is
9684 best
9685 to
9686 begin
9687 at
9688 a
9689 slow
9690 speed
9691 and
9692 gradually
9693 move
9694 up
9695 to
9696 high
9697 when
9698 beating
9699 egg
9700 whites
9701 When
9702 your
9703 egg
9704 whites
9705 get
9706 fluffy
9707 STOP
9708 If
9709 you
9710 overbeat
9711 them
9712 they
9713 will
9714 liquify
9715 again
9716 Use
9717 beaten
9718 egg
9719 whites
9720 right
9721 away
9722 Do
9723 not
9724 let
9725 them
9726 sit.
9727 <docid 27>
9728 If
9729 you
9730 have
9731 the
9732 food
9733 properly
9734 positioned,
9735 you
9736 should
9737 be
9738 able
9739 to
9740 broil
9741 with
9742 the
9743 door
9744 closed.
9745 Some
9746 people
9747 leave
9748 the
9749 door
9750 ajar
9751 to
9752 watch
9753 for
9754 flare-ups,
9755 especially
9756 when
9757 cooking
9758 fatty
9759 cuts,
9760 or
9761 so
9762 the
9763 food
9764 does
9765 not
9766 get
9767 overly
9768 brown.
9769 Of
9770 course,
9771 leaving
9772 the
9773 door
9774 open
9775 can
9776 created
9777 a
9778 greasy
9779 splatter
9780 mess
9781 to
9782 clean
9783 up
9784 outside
9785 the
9786 oven.
9787 If
9788 you
9789 are
9790 just
9791 browning
9792 the
9793 top
9794 (such
9795 as
9796 a
9797 casserole,
9798 etc.),
9799 then
9800 you
9801 might
9802 want
9803 to
9804 leave
9805 it
9806 open
9807 and
9808 watch
9809 it
9810 closely
9811 to
9812 remove
9813 it
9814 at
9815 just
9816 the
9817 right
9818 moment.
9819 Here
9820 are
9821 some
9822 broiling
9823 tips:
9824 When
9825 instructions
9826 call
9827 for
9828 broiling
9829 4
9830 inches
9831 from
9832 the
9833 heat
9834 source,
9835 this
9836 means
9837 4
9838 inches
9839 from
9840 the
9841 heating
9842 source
9843 to
9844 the
9845 top
9846 of
9847 the
9848 food.
9849 Use
9850 a
9851 ruler
9852 to
9853 judge
9854 properly.
9855 Begin
9856 broiling
9857 with
9858 the
9859 food
9860 at
9861 room
9862 temperature.
9863 To
9864 make
9865 clean-up
9866 easier,
9867 spray
9868 the
9869 broiler
9870 and
9871 drip
9872 tray
9873 with
9874 cooking
9875 spray
9876 or
9877 cover
9878 with
9879 foil.
9880 Trim
9881 off
9882 excess
9883 fat
9884 to
9885 avoid
9886 flare-ups.
9887 Putting
9888 a
9889 slice
9890 of
9891 bread
9892 in
9893 the
9894 drip
9895 pan
9896 will
9897 soak
9898 up
9899 oil
9900 drips
9901 and
9902 also
9903 help
9904 to
9905 avoid
9906 flare-ups.
9907 Be
9908 sure
9909 to
9910 preheat
9911 broiler
9912 and
9913 pan.
9914 For
9915 thin
9916 cuts
9917 of
9918 meat
9919 /
9920 fish
9921 /
9922 poultry,
9923 place
9924 closer
9925 to
9926 the
9927 heat
9928 source.
9929 Thicker
9930 cuts
9931 should
9932 be
9933 farther
9934 away
9935 so
9936 that
9937 the
9938 interior
9939 can
9940 cook
9941 through
9942 without
9943 the
9944 exterior
9945 being
9946 burned
9947 to
9948 a
9949 crisp.
9950 If
9951 you
9952 are
9953 using
9954 a
9955 basting
9956 liquid,
9957 warm
9958 it
9959 a
9960 bit.
9961 Cold
9962 basting
9963 liquid
9964 will
9965 slow
9966 down
9967 the
9968 browning
9969 and
9970 cooking.
9971 Low-fat
9972 dressing
9973 makes
9974 a
9975 good
9976 basting
9977 liquid.
